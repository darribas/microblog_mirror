				"content_html": "<p>It&rsquo;s that time of the year. <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> Spotify just dropped Wrapped.\nThe lists of the best everything in 2024 start rolling on.\nAnd I can&rsquo;t help having a go at mine. <sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> One of the few practices I&rsquo;ve kept over the years, even in the face of pretty\nsubstantial life style changes (e.g., baby) is reading. So, here&rsquo;s my list of\nbooks from 2024.\nLet&rsquo;s get all due caveats out of the way first of all. It&rsquo;s\ntechnically not a &ldquo;best of&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;all of&rdquo;. I did not <em>love</em> all the\nbooks in there, but I did read them. Unlike many smart people profess, I have a really hard time\ngiving up on a book I have started. This year though, I&rsquo;m glad I stuck with all\nof them. Also, technically, I did not <em>read</em> all of them either. A good chunk of\nthem I listened to while doing the dishes (more on this below). And, at the risk of stating the obvious, it&rsquo;s\nDecember 11th., the year has not ended. I&rsquo;m currently on three books\n(<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/144421737-what-if-we-get-it-right\">one</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40859000-delta-v\">two</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112976320-how-infrastructure-works?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=HAl0FKAfW5&amp;rank=1\">three</a>)\nthat I might or not finnish before the year is out. All are very good.\nUnless something radical changes, none would replace my picks this year.\nSo, on we go.</p>\n<p>If by best we mean a book that makes you stay up way too late reading, and you\nthink about long after you&rsquo;ve finished, the clear winner this year is <em>The\nDeluge</em>. It&rsquo;s hard to state in words how much I liked what is a 900p. book mostly\nabout climate change. Don&rsquo;t be fooled though, this is not the type of\nsci/cli-fi where characters and story are simple vehicles for the Big Ideas.\nThere are lots of those (Big Ideas), but there are also real characters.\nPeople you come to love, despise, and find uncomfortably close to you. Since I\nfinished it, I&rsquo;ve been looking for someone, anyone, who&rsquo;s read it too and is\nup for a coffee, because there are so many bits I&rsquo;d like to discuss with\nanother human about this book. Unfortunately though, the search goes on&hellip;</p>\n<p>The other book that surprised me in many and good ways was <em>Doppelganger</em>.\nI&rsquo;m the proud owner of a 1,999 paper copy of NoLogo, which I devoured as a\nhighschool student. After that, I figured there would be little in Naomi\nKlein&rsquo;s writing I wouldn&rsquo;t agree with or would change my views, so did not\nread more. How wrong I was. Admittedly, this is the most and least Klein book\nI can think of. It is something only her could have written and only now,\nafter decades of craft. And is a really hard book to pull off. It&rsquo;s about so\nmany things (her confusion with Naomi Wolf, conspiracy theories, right-wing\npolitics in the XXIst Century, doppelgangers in culture and art over history,\nJewish identity&hellip;) that it is hard to classify or even summarise. But it&rsquo;s\nwell worth your time. Go read (listen to) it.</p>\n<p>Honorary mentions. This has been a good year for reads. It&rsquo;s also been a\nterrible year in many personal aspects of my life. In the worst of it in May,\nI picked up <em>Where there&rsquo;s a will</em>, and I&rsquo;m so glad I did. Chappell&rsquo;s account\nof what it really means to win a race so brutal like the Transcontinental is\neverything I needed to read about human endurance, empathy, and\nhumbleness.\n<em>Impossible people</em> was also a phenomenal (graphic) read.

My friend Al turned me on to\nthis, and I&rsquo;m so glad he did. This is L.A. Confidential from the\nAfrican-American perspective.

For what is worth, I do agree\nwith the snob argument that reading is a better way to engage with writing\nthan listening. It gives you more space to think and let the content change\nyou. It&rsquo;s just that such option is not in the cards right\nnow.\nSecond, I have tried to read as much from women as from men now for a few\nyears, with varying degrees of success. This year I think I was fairly OK with\nit. This year, it&rsquo;s almost been a perfect split between fiction (men) and\nnon-fiction (women). I need more female fiction\nrecommendations!\nAnd third, something I started this year is to systematically take notes and\nwrite down impressions as I was reading. I started towards the autumn, so I&rsquo;ll\nreserve conclusions on that for the future (including whether the practice\nsticks at all!).</p>\n<p>So, that&rsquo;s it, one more year.

				"content_text": "It's that time of the year. [^1] Spotify just dropped Wrapped.\nThe lists of the best everything in 2024 start rolling on.\nAnd I can't help having a go at mine. [^2] One of the few practices I've kept over the years, even in the face of pretty\nsubstantial life style changes (e.g., baby) is reading. So, here's my list of\nbooks from 2024.\nLet's get all due caveats out of the way first of all. It's\ntechnically not a \"best of\" but rather \"all of\". I did not _love_ all the\nbooks in there, but I did read them. Unlike many smart people profess, I have a really hard time\ngiving up on a book I have started. This year though, I'm glad I stuck with all\nof them. Also, technically, I did not _read_ all of them either. A good chunk of\nthem I listened to while doing the dishes (more on this below). And, at the risk of stating the obvious, it's\nDecember 11th., the year has not ended. I'm currently on three books \n([one](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/144421737-what-if-we-get-it-right),\n[two](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40859000-delta-v),\n[three](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112976320-how-infrastructure-works?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=HAl0FKAfW5&rank=1))\nthat I might or not finnish before the year is out. All are very good.\nUnless something radical changes, none would replace my picks this year.\nSo, on we go.\n\nIf by best we mean a book that makes you stay up way too late reading, and you\nthink about long after you've finished, the clear winner this year is _The\nDeluge_. It's hard to state in words how much I liked what is a 900p. book mostly\nabout climate change. Don't be fooled though, this is not the type of\nsci/cli-fi where characters and story are simple vehicles for the Big Ideas.\nThere are lots of those (Big Ideas), but there are also real characters.\nPeople you come to love, despise, and find uncomfortably close to you. Since I\nfinished it, I've been looking for someone, anyone, who's read it too and is\nup for a coffee, because there are so many bits I'd like to discuss with\nanother human about this book. Unfortunately though, the search goes on...\n\nThe other book that surprised me in many and good ways was _Doppelganger_.\nI'm the proud owner of a 1,999 paper copy of NoLogo, which I devoured as a\nhighschool student. After that, I figured there would be little in Naomi\nKlein's writing I wouldn't agree with or would change my views, so did not\nread more. How wrong I was. Admittedly, this is the most and least Klein book\nI can think of. It is something only her could have written and only now,\nafter decades of craft. And is a really hard book to pull off. It's about so\nmany things (her confusion with Naomi Wolf, conspiracy theories, right-wing\npolitics in the XXIst Century, doppelgangers in culture and art over history,\nJewish identity...) that it is hard to classify or even summarise. But it's\nwell worth your time. Go read (listen to) it.\n\nHonorary mentions. This has been a good year for reads. It's also been a\nterrible year in many personal aspects of my life. In the worst of it in May,\nI picked up _Where there's a will_, and I'm so glad I did. Chappell's account\nof what it really means to win a race so brutal like the Transcontinental is\neverything I needed to read about human endurance, empathy, and\nhumbleness.\n_Impossible people_ was also a phenomenal (graphic) read. Wertz's account of\nher own alcoholism is so raw, hopeful, and just pure\nfunny.\nAnd last but not least, _Devil in a blue dress_. My friend Al turned me on to\nthis, and I'm so glad he did. This is L.A. Confidential from the\nAfrican-American perspective. It's a great detective story, it's so well\nwritten, and it's an approach to race that, although written in the early 90s,\nreads just as fresh in 2024.\n\nA couple of thoughts to close. First, almost all\nnon-fiction I consumed this year was listened. I'd love to have the brightness\nand mental capacity to spend 40 minutes every night getting lost in thorough\narguments. The truth is I don't. Instead, I do have about that time every\nnight when I wash the dishes and clean the kitchen. One day, in an ideal\nworld, I'll do all my reading, well, by reading.
