				"content_html": "<p>It’s that time of the year (again). <a href=\"https://me.darribas.org/2024/12/11/books-read-in.html\">Last year</a> was the second time and, if I manage a third one this year, we can start calling it a tradition. And I quite like traditions like this. Before we get into the good stuff, one clarification. The sharp eye will have noticed I did drop “book” in this year’s title. This is all but unintended. In part, it is a bit of ego caressing<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>, in part it might be something a little more meaningful. Earlier in the year, I signed up for <a href=\"https://readwise.io/read\">Reader</a> and, later on, I picked up an <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/656174/boox-go-7-series-e-ink-e-reader-stylus-color\">Onyx Boox</a>. All of a sudden, the whole of the internet was presented to me like a book I could take to bed without distractions. That’s taken its toll on actual books<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>, but it’s not been for nothing. I have read more long-reads and discovered more perspectives than I’d have been able by focusing only on books. So, this year, I’m giving them a spot on my review by highlighting the ones that have made a mark as of December (way too many to list wholly, but you can see a sample in my <a href=\"https://me.darribas.org/categories/links/\">link blog</a>). With that out of the way, enough of intros, links and footnotes (you can see a full list of books and links at the bottom), let’s do it.</p>\n<p>This year, there’s not been a clear winner on non-fiction, like last year. There’s been a few really good ones that I’ve returned to in a less obsessive way over the subsequent months. I greatly enjoyed <em>What if we get it right?</em> and it might be one of the few instances where I think the audiobook is probably a better medium. It’s set up as interviews with a bunch of people from all corners of life on what “getting it right” with the climate would look like. The audiobook contains the actual interviews, not a readout of them. Not all of them touched me in the same way, but enough of them made me think in slightly different ways about climate change.  I also really liked <em>How infrastructure works</em>. It’s less of a thrilling read, more of a slow, boring in the best possible sense of the word (calm, undistracted) one. If you stick to it and get past some aspects of the tone, there’s plenty to like and learn on the other side. One of them was the insight of how the challenge in infrastructure for the XXIst Century is going from a world where resources felt unlimited but energy limited to one of “infinite energy and finite materials”. And the core message of the book is also one to retain with you: that infrastructure is, at its best, shared care, humanity coming together to care for each other at scale. Try to find that elsewhere.</p>\n<p>It was also a good year of fiction. No five stars but plenty of fours. I got around (pun intended!) to read <em>Orbital</em> and thought it was very well written but, perhaps, not more. I liked <em>Delta-V</em> because it came at a time where I was really in the mood for good, “hard” sci-fi, it’s pretty much that and it delivers at it. And speaking of traditions, I returned to the Slough House series for my yearly fix, ahead of the TV version. All in all, most very satisfactory, almost none much of a surprise. The closest I came to it was <em>Bluebird, Bluebird</em>, which was a new author to me and a new detective series set in contemporary East Texas. It was a nice mix of good detective execution and a great context setting in terms of race, culture and idiosyncracies of that corner of the world.</p>\n<p>And now for the ”new” medium, the Internet. According to Reader, I’ve highlighted (my measure of whether a text had anything I wanted to remember or not) 262 items this year. Many of them were technical, irrelevant by now (AI!) or not that memorable. A few of them have managed to stick to my brain in ways that have surprised me. About half of them were about AI in one way or another, there was sooo much of it this year, some of it was even good! I read a lot of Cory Doctorow, so it’s no surprise something from him made the list. I’m a bit saturated of “enshitification” at this point, but his new big idea, Reverse Centaurs and how AI is being designed to be helped by humans rather than the other way around is as interesting as it gets, I imagine we’ll hear more of it in 2026. I finally got around reading (listening to!) AI as Normal Technology and can confirm all the chatter around it is justified. I enjoyed particularly the first of the three parts, which focuses on the economics of the technology and how it will (or not) spread throughout the economy. This is econ 101 but, sometimes, you “just” need the basics well understood. Speaking of understanding well, Neal Stephenson has some thoughts too (and a new newsletter!). From his post on AI I took the “every augmentation is also an amputation” quote (which was actually from Marshall McLuhan), and it’s returned to me every time I read a new shiny app feature description that promises to make me so much more productive. Harper Reed is one of the few folks occupying the shared space in a Venn Diagram with people excited about AI and people I like and respect, and his “codegen” hero’s journey is equal parts insightful and fun(ny). A bit of a technical one, so indulge me but, if you are into satellites, the TerraWatch newsletter is a treat in your inbox. His recent take on why privatising basic Earth Observation is a terrible idea is a good entry point. To wrap up, two very different and very personal reads that involve absolutely zero AI or technical stuff. I don’t know how I came across Mike Monteiro, but his newsletter has stuck in my read digest. I imagine it’s the combination of honesty, rawness and the occasional insight. His recent post about flying to bury his father (after a very complicated history) is all those three condensed and multiplied by several x’s. And the final one, a very apt one at that, is by Craig Mod. I’ve read a lot of him (no less his phenomenal book on walking in Japan) this year, so it’s also no surprise he makes the list. This one is a retrospective on the house in Tokyo he’s selling. But it’s really a meditation about all the time he’s passed there, what’s meant to him, and how the house was both context and sometimes even content to much of it. It’s beautiful.</p>\n<p>And that does it for this year! If you(‘ve) read any of the above, remember next time you see me one of the few things I like more than reading is <em>talking</em> about reading. If there are others I should read, hit me up with recommendations. Life’s too short to fill it with mediocre reads.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fiction\">Fiction</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/561976/delta-v-by-daniel-suarez/\">Delta-V</a> by Daniel Suarez</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://torpublishinggroup.com/rose-house/\">Rose/House</a> by Arkady Martine</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199841424-la-asombrosa-tienda-de-la-se-ora-yeom\">La asombrosa tienda de la señora Yeom</a> by Kim Ho-yeon</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/146316076-foundry\">Foundry</a> by Eliot Peper</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/739012/simplicity-by-mattie-lubchansky/\">Simplicity</a>, by Mattie Lubchansky</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/576037/london-rules-by-mick-herron/\">London Rules</a> by Mick Herron</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://groveatlantic.com/book/orbital/\">Orbital</a> by Samantha Harvey</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/attica-locke/bluebird-bluebird/9780316363310/\">Bluebird, Bluebird</a> by Attica Locke</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219761842-ice-s-end\">Ice&rsquo;s End</a> by P.

I also really liked _How infrastructure works_. It’s less of a thrilling read, more of a slow, boring in the best possible sense of the word (calm, undistracted) one. If you stick to it and get past some aspects of the tone, there’s plenty to like and learn on the other side. One of them was the insight of how the challenge in infrastructure for the XXIst Century is going from a world where resources felt unlimited but energy limited to one of “infinite energy and finite materials”. And the core message of the book is also one to retain with you: that infrastructure is, at its best, shared care, humanity coming together to care for each other at scale. Try to find that elsewhere.\n\nIt was also a good year of fiction. No five stars but plenty of fours. I got around (pun intended!) to read _Orbital_ and thought it was very well written but, perhaps, not more. I liked _Delta-V_ because it came at a time where I was really in the mood for good, “hard” sci-fi, it’s pretty much that and it delivers at it. And speaking of traditions, I returned to the Slough House series for my yearly fix, ahead of the TV version. All in all, most very satisfactory, almost none much of a surprise. The closest I came to it was _Bluebird, Bluebird_, which was a new author to me and a new detective series set in contemporary East Texas. It was a nice mix of good detective execution and a great context setting in terms of race, culture and idiosyncracies of that corner of the world.\n\nAnd now for the ”new” medium, the Internet. According to Reader, I’ve highlighted (my measure of whether a text had anything I wanted to remember or not) 262 items this year. Many of them were technical, irrelevant by now (AI!) or not that memorable. A few of them have managed to stick to my brain in ways that have surprised me. About half of them were about AI in one way or another, there was sooo much of it this year, some of it was even good! I read a lot of Cory Doctorow, so it’s no surprise something from him made the list. I’m a bit saturated of “enshitification” at this point, but his new big idea, Reverse Centaurs and how AI is being designed to be helped by humans rather than the other way around is as interesting as it gets, I imagine we’ll hear more of it in 2026. I finally got around reading (listening to!) AI as Normal Technology and can confirm all the chatter around it is justified. I enjoyed particularly the first of the three parts, which focuses on the economics of the technology and how it will (or not) spread throughout the economy. This is econ 101 but, sometimes, you “just” need the basics well understood. Speaking of understanding well, Neal Stephenson has some thoughts too (and a new newsletter!). From his post on AI I took the “every augmentation is also an amputation” quote (which was actually from Marshall McLuhan), and it’s returned to me every time I read a new shiny app feature description that promises to make me so much more productive. Harper Reed is one of the few folks occupying the shared space in a Venn Diagram with people excited about AI and people I like and respect, and his “codegen” hero’s journey is equal parts insightful and fun(ny). A bit of a technical one, so indulge me but, if you are into satellites, the TerraWatch newsletter is a treat in your inbox. His recent take on why privatising basic Earth Observation is a terrible idea is a good entry point. To wrap up, two very different and very personal reads that involve absolutely zero AI or technical stuff. I don’t know how I came across Mike Monteiro, but his newsletter has stuck in my read digest. I imagine it’s the combination of honesty, rawness and the occasional insight. His recent post about flying to bury his father (after a very complicated history) is all those three condensed and multiplied by several x’s. And the final one, a very apt one at that, is by Craig Mod. I’ve read a lot of him (no less his phenomenal book on walking in Japan) this year, so it’s also no surprise he makes the list. This one is a retrospective on the house in Tokyo he’s selling. But it’s really a meditation about all the time he’s passed there, what’s meant to him, and how the house was both context and sometimes even content to much of it. It’s beautiful.\n\nAnd that does it for this year! If you(‘ve) read any of the above, remember next time you see me one of the few things I like more than reading is _talking_ about reading. If there are others I should read, hit me up with recommendations. Life’s too short to fill it with mediocre reads.\n\n\n## Fiction\n\n1.

Then Google came along, and proved that using a lot of cheap PCs running open-source software was cheaper and much more scalable.

I was in the tech industry during the dot com boom, and I saw a similar dynamic with Sun workstations. For a couple of years every startup needed to raise millions of dollars just to launch a website, because the only real option was buying expensive Sun servers and closed software. Then Google came along, and proved that using a lot of cheap PCs running open-source software was cheaper and much more scalable. Nvidia these days feels like Sun did then, and so I bet over the next few years there will be a lot of chatbot startups based on cheap PCs with open source models running on CPUs.

				"content_html": "<p>I’m just back from my first <a href=\"https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/events/human-planet-forum-2025-2025-11-19_en\">Human Planet Forum</a>. In its own words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Human Planet Forum 2025 is a flagship event of the <a href=\"https://earthobservations.org/groups/geo-human-planet\">GEO Human Planet Initiative (GHP)</a> which works to understand and map human presence on earth using open geospatial data.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In my own, it’s an (the?) opportunity to see in one room, at the same time, all the wonderful nerds behind some of the most interesting data products using earth observation (EO) to map the world’s population. As an understatement, I was <em>excited</em>.</p>\n<p>The organisers kindly asked me to prepare a ten minute summary of the event that’d help conclude it. As my email inbox will attest, I “had to” pay attention to all presentations, and thus the opportunity cost of getting distracted was higher than usual. I’m glad I was given this constraint because it made me appreciate the event and what was presented there much more. Below is a write up of that summary. Heads up, this is <em>not</em> a detailed account of each presentation (for that, you’ll have to wait for the report the JRC will put out in time), more of an opinionated view of what the event represents and why it is valuable.</p>\n<p>I structured my contribution along three key dimensions: domains discussed, perspectives used, and common threads. I then added two extra slides, one with themes that will keep this community busy for the foreseeable future, and one with my own perspectives to wrap up.</p>\n<p>Start with the <em>domains</em>. There was an important chunk of time spent discussing new ways and products that characterise environments. A lot of this is the evolution from the earlier work defining the extent of human settlements (the HS in GHSL!), and it’s very welcome to see these attempts becoming more sophisticated, adding more depth and providing more detail than what it has already been shown possible. It was not surprising to see a lot of work also towards identifying, measuring and monitoring disasters, vulnerability and exposure. Underlying it all was the looming presence of climate change and the consequences it is increasingly having on human systems. And one of the key distinctions between this meeting and almost any other one I can think of is its ambition to combine these domains with socio-economic aspects. Of course, population estimates is by now a staple of this community, but we also heard from efforts to characterise the building stock, the degree of urbanisation, or poverty, to name a few.</p>\n<p>I identified three key <em>perspectives</em>. One is presentations on advances in the field, technical or otherwise. What are the things we can now do we couldn’t a few years ago? The second is a focus on introducing foundational layers. The word foundation has lost much meaning in the past few years “thanks” to the AI hype around LLMs<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>, but its use here referred to something more meaningful: data layers built to develop a lot of applications on top of them, to be used by a wide range of stakeholders in a variety of contexts, and relied upon for many years to come. This aspect of temporal continuity for me deserves special praise. While the Valley mentality of “disrupting”, using the latest and greatest to put out catchy data products has its (mostly demonstrational) value, to me it pales in comparison with the commitment to support a data product over time.</p>\n<p>All of the above stems from a series of shared values, a common narrative, that permeated through pretty much everything that was said in the meeting. The first is the very clear ambition to develop and use data to inform real decisions. There was a very interesting debate across different sessions of how much this ambition should dictate the data we develop and how we go about this task. The appeal to tailor something as close as possible to what decision makers state they need is clear. Less clear to me until I heard it was the notion that maybe such stakeholders are not always aware of what is possible and hence, when they specify needs, miss opportunities. It is then up to us to grab such opportunities to show new ways in which data can influence policy. There was also a lot of discussion about the need for capacity building, for addressing that “last-mile delivery” challenge to make sure the data and insights we develop have real impact. I half joked that, in some cases, I’m not sure how long that mile is. Sometimes, it feels our outputs should inform decisions, but in reality there’s a broader gap between them and the evidence needed to make a difference. At any rate, that this conversation featured so prominently across sessions seems to me like like a very healthy pre-condition to figure out the best way forward. And, finally, the third common thread was the value of Open. Everyone here understands that, for this work to be relevant, it is imperative it be openly available through permissive licenses. This is in contrast to other academic fora where my sense is that openness is seen as a desirable though not critical feature of work. I think the Human Planet folks are “on the right side of history” here.</p>\n<p>After touching on domains, perspectives and common threads, I reflected on themes that, in my view, will remain relevant in the coming years, despite all progress already made. The first was the tension between developing global products and aiming to influence local decisions. This is what I called the <em>everything, everywhere, all the time</em> goal of the data products we develop. This is not only an aspirational goal, it is one whose goalposts are constantly shifting (what was “high resolution” or “frequent” five years ago is no longer now), so the need to always push the envelope does not go away with technological advances. To me the real value of the goal is not achieving it <em>per-se</em> (it is always going to somehow elude us), but to help focus our minds about the direction of travel and the “itinerary”: what are the pieces we really cannot sacrifice and which ones we can give up in the name of actually existing datasets? The second point I raised was that notion of “last-mile” discussed above. Figuring this one out will keep us entertained for a while. And the third was the need to continue standardising and harmonising data and approaches to make the ecosystem more useful than the sum of its (data product) parts. As more datasets are created, this becomes more important, but also more onerous.</p>\n<p>I closed with three thoughts this Human Planet Forum has stimulated. First is this notion I’ve been mulling over for a while of EO as a data source of <em>first</em> resort. For a long time, at least in social science, one would use satellites because the data one was really interested in wasn&rsquo;t available (a census, a survey, a building cadaster….). I think the time is ripe for this to change. Data from satellites (and the techniques we now have to work with them) have advanced to a point where I think, in many cases, they make for the best option. This is not fully obvious to everyone (yet) and perhaps it needs a bit more of shouting from people like us to spread this gospel. The second is the value, not only of pushing the boundaries of what is possible with these data, but also to bring such boundaries to the masses. So much of science gets “locked” in niche communities because it is too complicated, obscure, or there is no effort to disseminate. We cannot afford this with advances in satellite data. In this context, I really take away the idea of the “last-mile” as a neat way to encapsulate much of this challenge (and, perhaps, part of its solution). The final reflection I made is that there’s a lot of opportunity in bringing in conversation work along these lines of the Global North with that of the Global South. A lot of the focus in this community has historically focused in less developed countries (see the point about data of last resort above). As technology gets better and becomes more relevant not as a substitute for another data, but as the main focus, I think there’s a great opportunity for all the lessons learned while working on the Global South to be shared and amplified elsewhere. Yet more avenues for cross-pollination and collaboration.</p>\n<p>And that was it. As I mentioned at the start, these were three very intense but extremely productive days. Michele and team did a stellar job in putting a fantastic show together and I’d like to thank them again for letting me be part of it.

				"content_html": "<p>Earlier this week, I attended a workshop on Geo Foundation Models put together by <a href=\"https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography/staff/13092/dr-weiming-huang\">Weiming Huang</a> and <a href=\"https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography/staff/1069/dr-nick-malleson\">Nick Malleson</a>, both at Leeds. It was a small group, high interaction day with plenty of coffee breaks to follow up con comments, and discussions as close to blue sky as academia permits these days. As the cool kids say, extremely high signal to noise ratio.</p>\n<p>My contribution was a five minute talk on why embeddings (and, in particular, embeddings from satellite imagery) are a very cool technology we should be paying more attention in social research and policy. I titled it, in an attempt to sound clickbait&rsquo;y, &ldquo;(Imagery) embeddings for the rest of us&rdquo;. The point I wanted to make was that, in my view, embeddings are one of the coolest (new) ways we have to democratise access to much of the value that satellite imagery has to offer. This is particularly so for communities who have not been able to engage much with but stand to benefit from satellites. But I&rsquo;m getting ahead of myself. In this post, I wanted to give a quick overview of what those five minutes were. Here you go.</p>\n<p>I started framing embeddings from <a href=\"https://imago.ac.uk\">Imago</a>&rsquo;s perspective. At Imago, we work to make satellite imagery more <em>useful</em>, <em>useable</em>, and <em>used</em> across social research and policy. A big part of this is about developing data products that translate pixels into data that meet our users &ldquo;where they are&rdquo;. That is, we take relevant information from pixels and provide it in familiar formats (e.g., Census geographies), in transformed/aggregated ways (e.g., tabular) that resonate more with how social mindsets would think.</p>\n<p>Then I moved on to embeddings. It was a bit silly to include a slide on what embeddings are for a room full of experts on this area. Nevertheless, I did it because I thought it&rsquo;d be useful to frame how <em>I</em> see embeddings in this context. As such, I defined embeddings as the internal representation a neural net builds from an image. This ends up being a vector of values that provides a dense but compressed representation of the statistical information encoded in an image. In more human-friendly terms, this is a bit like &ldquo;an image, as seen by a computer&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Now, here&rsquo;s where the talk starts getting more interesting (hopefully). Why are embeddings, such an obscure property of modern neural architectures, so important for socially-minded folks? In my view, at least for three reasons. First, it&rsquo;s a very direct translation of what is essentially a multi-dimensional tensor (an image) into tabular format. The embedding is a flat, one-dimensional (mostly) representation of an image<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>, a very complex data structure. It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;buffer&rdquo; that helps the non-initiated user to <em>not</em> have to touch a raw image, with all of its challenges, but to still get most of the benefits of doing so. Think of it as having the cake and eating it. Second, embeddings are not limited to a single type of image. Modern models are multi-sensor (i.e., they can incorporate different satellite feeds) and even multi-modal (e.g., combining satellite with other data types such as traditional geographic features). To me, this is an opportunity to make many data feeds, traditionally left aside for being &ldquo;too hard to work with&rdquo;, a first-class citizen in &ldquo;tabular-land&rdquo;, and maybe even a way to integrate seamlessly different communities that&rsquo;d usually not speak to each other. And third, it&rsquo;s 2025, we&rsquo;re talking about embeddings because they&rsquo;re tightly linked to foundation models, pre-trained general purpose encoders that can generate such embeddings easily once available. This is a really exciting field to observe these days. In the talk, I included a slide with examples of such models released (mostly) openly from Google, NASA, ESA, IBM and Cambridge. All of those examples were, at most, three months old.</p>\n<p>As an illustration, I gave a few examples of what one can easily do with these embeddings. They&rsquo;re ideal for &ldquo;semantic search&rdquo;, where you are interested in finding locations that <em>look</em>, in fundamental ways, similar to another one (e.g., what is another area in the UK that looks like my neighbourhood in Liverpool?). They&rsquo;re natural inputs for unsupervised classifications built with K-means or more modern algorithms (e.g., what are the key <em>types</em> of areas in this region?). And they have a <em>lot</em> of potential to help easily spot change (e.g., has this area changed between the two periods for which we have images?). Of course, these are the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; uses embeddings are being used for. One of the things I&rsquo;m really excited about taking embeddings to a much broader audience of domain experts is seeing what they can do with them to help solve their specific challenges.</p>\n<p>I closed the talk reflecting a bit why this is not commonplace yet. In particular, I brough up three thoughts. The first one is that what I had just said sounds likely obvious to the group I was speaking to (experts at the intersection of AI and Geo), but to pretty much no one else. We were about 30 people and I&rsquo;m not sure many more in the UK (in relative terms) might appreciate the power of these ideas. We need to change this and I think this group is ideally placed to do so. Then I moved on to the two key challenges I see in widespread adoption of embeddings among social folks. One is definitely <em>technical</em>: it is still tricky and cumbersome to work with embeddings. This I&rsquo;m less worried about because I can see how there are ways in which we could lower the access barrier and, more importantly, we already have vehicles (e.g., Imago and the rest of <a href=\"https://www.sdruk.ukri.org/data/\">SDR-UK data services</a> are a great example). So, things seem in motion on this front. The other one is more <em>philosophical</em>: embeddings are tremendously useful, but they&rsquo;re not the most transparent way to work with imagery, precisely because the compression that makes them very useable also makes them obscure. For good reasons, social scientists and adjacent folks tend to be very sceptical of obscure measurements. But this doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s no value at all in engaging with the technology. We need a lot of evangelism and a bit of research to bring better understanding of how to use embeddings productively in these domains.</p>\n<p>And that was that! In classic professorial style, I totally over-run my five minutes, something I&rsquo;m not proud of. Weiming very politely brought everything back in line and we moved on.

				"title": "The case for satellite imagery in social science and policymaking: A sketch from my talks in China",
				"content_html": "<p>Last week I came back from ten days in China on a research project. It was a whirlwind tour with five cities, and lots of opportunities to interact with both the, academic and otherwise, Chinese world. It was fascinating. At many levels, it felt like a peek into the future.</p>\n<p>As part of the trip, I had the opportunity to give two talks, one at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in Beijing and another at Southwest University in Chongqing. Both were titled &ldquo;<em>Making satellite imagery more useful, usable, and used in Social Science and policymaking</em>&rdquo;, and both had a very similar structure. The CAS talk was a bit longer, and it allowed me to illustrate practically many of the ideas I talked about in the first part using our ongoing <a href=\"https://github.com/eurofab-project\">EuroFab</a>. Here I want to focus on the more conceptual bit, which aligns very much with the motivation behind <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/sdr-imago/\">Imago</a>.</p>\n<p>The talk tries to build the case for paying more attention and interest to satellite imagery as a source of data and information in the context of social science and policymaking. I structured this argument in four acts<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>: the value proposition, the promise, the reason, and the gap.</p>\n<p>Start with the value proposition. We&rsquo;re at the confluence of three trends that make this a unique moment to look at satellite imagery with &ldquo;untraditional&rdquo; eyes. One, there&rsquo;s never been more and better satellite(s and) imagery available. Launching stuff into space is becoming dramatically cheaper than it used to be. As Econ 101 would predict, you lower the price of something, more of that is bought, and we have more and more satellites being placed on orbit (<em>more data</em>). These are also benefitting from the revolution in consumer electronics of the last few decades, so the sensors on board are able to capture much more than before (<em>better data</em>). Second, we have better ways of extracting information from such imagery. Images contain a lot of useful information but it&rsquo;s all encoded in pixels that don&rsquo;t mean anything in themselves. To make something useful, you need a &ldquo;magic decoder&rdquo; that turns pixels into buildings, roads, land uses, etc. Well, the last fifteen years of progress in computer vision have delivered just that. From the first deep learning models of the early 2010s, into the more advanced neural nets of the end of the decade to contemporary foundation models for vision, how we teach computers to see things has undergone nothing short of a revolution. And third, which seems less relevant but it&rsquo;s the piece that makes it all possible, the technology stack required to access such algorithms and operate on such data has been dramatically democratised. Compute is cheap(ish) and software is free(ish). It&rsquo;s a brave new world.</p>\n<p>Now the promise. What the confluence of the three trends above means for social researchers and policymakers is we can now do at least two things we couldn&rsquo;t before. One, to measure things we haven&rsquo;t been able to measure (at scale); and two, to measure better, sooner and/or more often things we&rsquo;re now measuring slowly, late and sparsely. Both are, in some ways, the two sides of the same coin. They capture how the same &ldquo;opening up&rdquo; of new sources of information affect different status quo. In some cases (e.g., temperature, air quality, certain features of the built environment such as solar panel installations), we have not been able to measure certain phenomena that are relevant for social processes at the scale and detail required to consider them seriously in our work. In others, we do have a current solution, but it is lacking in many ways and we use it because it&rsquo;s better than nothing, not because it&rsquo;s good. For many of these cases, I think satellite imagery is poised to redefine what we consider acceptable for data feeding into research and policy.</p>\n<p>Why, beyond &ldquo;just because we can&rdquo;, <em>should</em> we try to realise such promise? The short version is we&rsquo;ve never needed new, timely and accurate data more than now. The world is becoming more unstable and unpredictable (e.g., climate change, spatial inequalities). We can&rsquo;t &ldquo;wait for the next Census&rdquo; (which might not even happen in some places!) to know how society and the built environment are changing. Decisions need to be made before then and, for those to be meaningful, there&rsquo;s a whole lot of understanding we need to unlock first. And, by the way, this is not a clash between traditional sources of data like the Census and newer ones like satellites. We need both of them, separately, but particularly in tandem: satellites can &ldquo;stretch&rdquo; the value of Censuses by, for example, providing additional context; and most of the value held by imagery relies almost entirely on our ability to relate them to existing measurements of phenomena we want, of labels. Our best shot at that &ldquo;labelling&rdquo; in the social realm are traditional sources.</p>\n<p>And, finally, why <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> we already realising this promise? This is what I called The Gap. Again, three main reasons in my view. One, imagery is <em>big</em>. If nothing else, there is a lot of it and it takes a lot of space on storage disks. To a point that changes how you have to think about working with it (this is the &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t fit in your laptop&rdquo; problem). Two, imagery is <em>hard</em>. The problem is not only that managing a large volume is challenging in itself, it&rsquo;s that it is also non-trivial to make something useful out of images. Something something, magic decoders, something, something. And, yes, these have become much more accessible, but it&rsquo;s still the case the science underpinning all of this is tricky. And, three, imagery is <em>different</em>. We don&rsquo;t train social scientists to work with images.

				"content_text": "Last week I came back from ten days in China on a research project. It was a whirlwind tour with five cities, and lots of opportunities to interact with both the, academic and otherwise, Chinese world. It was fascinating. At many levels, it felt like a peek into the future. \n\nAs part of the trip, I had the opportunity to give two talks, one at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in Beijing and another at Southwest University in Chongqing. Both were titled \"*Making satellite imagery more useful, usable, and used in Social Science and policymaking*\", and both had a very similar structure. The CAS talk was a bit longer, and it allowed me to illustrate practically many of the ideas I talked about in the first part using our ongoing [EuroFab](https://github.com/eurofab-project). Here I want to focus on the more conceptual bit, which aligns very much with the motivation behind [Imago](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sdr-imago/).\n\nThe talk tries to build the case for paying more attention and interest to satellite imagery as a source of data and information in the context of social science and policymaking. I structured this argument in four acts[^1]: the value proposition, the promise, the reason, and the gap.\n\nStart with the value proposition. We're at the confluence of three trends that make this a unique moment to look at satellite imagery with \"untraditional\" eyes. One, there's never been more and better satellite(s and) imagery available. Launching stuff into space is becoming dramatically cheaper than it used to be. As Econ 101 would predict, you lower the price of something, more of that is bought, and we have more and more satellites being placed on orbit (*more data*). These are also benefitting from the revolution in consumer electronics of the last few decades, so the sensors on board are able to capture much more than before (*better data*). Second, we have better ways of extracting information from such imagery. Images contain a lot of useful information but it's all encoded in pixels that don't mean anything in themselves. To make something useful, you need a \"magic decoder\" that turns pixels into buildings, roads, land uses, etc. Well, the last fifteen years of progress in computer vision have delivered just that. From the first deep learning models of the early 2010s, into the more advanced neural nets of the end of the decade to contemporary foundation models for vision, how we teach computers to see things has undergone nothing short of a revolution. And third, which seems less relevant but it's the piece that makes it all possible, the technology stack required to access such algorithms and operate on such data has been dramatically democratised. Compute is cheap(ish) and software is free(ish). It's a brave new world.\n\nNow the promise. What the confluence of the three trends above means for social researchers and policymakers is we can now do at least two things we couldn't before. One, to measure things we haven't been able to measure (at scale); and two, to measure better, sooner and/or more often things we're now measuring slowly, late and sparsely. Both are, in some ways, the two sides of the same coin. They capture how the same \"opening up\" of new sources of information affect different status quo. In some cases (e.g., temperature, air quality, certain features of the built environment such as solar panel installations), we have not been able to measure certain phenomena that are relevant for social processes at the scale and detail required to consider them seriously in our work. In others, we do have a current solution, but it is lacking in many ways and we use it because it's better than nothing, not because it's good. For many of these cases, I think satellite imagery is poised to redefine what we consider acceptable for data feeding into research and policy.\n\nWhy, beyond \"just because we can\", _should_ we try to realise such promise? The short version is we've never needed new, timely and accurate data more than now. The world is becoming more unstable and unpredictable (e.g., climate change, spatial inequalities). We can't \"wait for the next Census\" (which might not even happen in some places!) to know how society and the built environment are changing. Decisions need to be made before then and, for those to be meaningful, there's a whole lot of understanding we need to unlock first. And, by the way, this is not a clash between traditional sources of data like the Census and newer ones like satellites. We need both of them, separately, but particularly in tandem: satellites can \"stretch\" the value of Censuses by, for example, providing additional context; and most of the value held by imagery relies almost entirely on our ability to relate them to existing measurements of phenomena we want, of labels. Our best shot at that \"labelling\" in the social realm are traditional sources.\n\nAnd, finally, why _aren't_ we already realising this promise? This is what I called The Gap. Again, three main reasons in my view. One, imagery is _big_. If nothing else, there is a lot of it and it takes a lot of space on storage disks. To a point that changes how you have to think about working with it (this is the \"it doesn't fit in your laptop\" problem). Two, imagery is _hard_. The problem is not only that managing a large volume is challenging in itself, it's that it is also non-trivial to make something useful out of images. Something something, magic decoders, something, something. And, yes, these have become much more accessible, but it's still the case the science underpinning all of this is tricky. And, three, imagery is _different_. We don't train social scientists to work with images. Local government officers and government analysts don't know where to start to make sense of it all. This is in contrast to other disciplines where imagery is front and centre, their bread and butter. Social sciences have, for a long time, spent all of their training allowance on other skills and techniques that are fundamentally different.\n\nSo that's it, my 20 minutes[^2] to convince you are up. If you're interested in these ideas and in acting on them, stay tuned for everything we're doing at [Imago](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sdr-imago/). It's still early days so much of what we're focused on is on getting started. Like any big ship, getting momentum takes a lot of energy and time. But once you're going...\n\n[^1]: An unwelcome departure from my beloved \"rule of three\" but, in this case, I do think it was warranted\n[^2]: That's what it took me in the talk, Firefox says this should take you 6 minutes to read.\n",

Much of what modern AI/ML does is making data that traditionally were beyond the realm of computation, computable. Think of text, audio, or images.

Modern techniques such as foundation models for both text (LLMs) and image make it possible to treat these sources as quantitative data. And this is a big deal.

In land use, this is also a pretty big advancement.

				"content_html": "<p>It&rsquo;s that time of the year. <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> Spotify just dropped Wrapped.\nThe lists of the best everything in 2024 start rolling on.\nAnd I can&rsquo;t help having a go at mine. <sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> One of the few practices I&rsquo;ve kept over the years, even in the face of pretty\nsubstantial life style changes (e.g., baby) is reading. So, here&rsquo;s my list of\nbooks from 2024.\nLet&rsquo;s get all due caveats out of the way first of all. It&rsquo;s\ntechnically not a &ldquo;best of&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;all of&rdquo;. I did not <em>love</em> all the\nbooks in there, but I did read them. Unlike many smart people profess, I have a really hard time\ngiving up on a book I have started. This year though, I&rsquo;m glad I stuck with all\nof them. Also, technically, I did not <em>read</em> all of them either. A good chunk of\nthem I listened to while doing the dishes (more on this below). And, at the risk of stating the obvious, it&rsquo;s\nDecember 11th., the year has not ended. I&rsquo;m currently on three books\n(<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/144421737-what-if-we-get-it-right\">one</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40859000-delta-v\">two</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112976320-how-infrastructure-works?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=HAl0FKAfW5&amp;rank=1\">three</a>)\nthat I might or not finnish before the year is out. All are very good.\nUnless something radical changes, none would replace my picks this year.\nSo, on we go.</p>\n<p>If by best we mean a book that makes you stay up way too late reading, and you\nthink about long after you&rsquo;ve finished, the clear winner this year is <em>The\nDeluge</em>. It&rsquo;s hard to state in words how much I liked what is a 900p. book mostly\nabout climate change. Don&rsquo;t be fooled though, this is not the type of\nsci/cli-fi where characters and story are simple vehicles for the Big Ideas.\nThere are lots of those (Big Ideas), but there are also real characters.\nPeople you come to love, despise, and find uncomfortably close to you. Since I\nfinished it, I&rsquo;ve been looking for someone, anyone, who&rsquo;s read it too and is\nup for a coffee, because there are so many bits I&rsquo;d like to discuss with\nanother human about this book. Unfortunately though, the search goes on&hellip;</p>\n<p>The other book that surprised me in many and good ways was <em>Doppelganger</em>.\nI&rsquo;m the proud owner of a 1,999 paper copy of NoLogo, which I devoured as a\nhighschool student. After that, I figured there would be little in Naomi\nKlein&rsquo;s writing I wouldn&rsquo;t agree with or would change my views, so did not\nread more. How wrong I was. Admittedly, this is the most and least Klein book\nI can think of. It is something only her could have written and only now,\nafter decades of craft. And is a really hard book to pull off. It&rsquo;s about so\nmany things (her confusion with Naomi Wolf, conspiracy theories, right-wing\npolitics in the XXIst Century, doppelgangers in culture and art over history,\nJewish identity&hellip;) that it is hard to classify or even summarise. But it&rsquo;s\nwell worth your time. Go read (listen to) it.</p>\n<p>Honorary mentions. This has been a good year for reads. It&rsquo;s also been a\nterrible year in many personal aspects of my life. In the worst of it in May,\nI picked up <em>Where there&rsquo;s a will</em>, and I&rsquo;m so glad I did. Chappell&rsquo;s account\nof what it really means to win a race so brutal like the Transcontinental is\neverything I needed to read about human endurance, empathy, and\nhumbleness.\n<em>Impossible people</em> was also a phenomenal (graphic) read. Wertz&rsquo;s account of\nher own alcoholism is so raw, hopeful, and just pure\nfunny.\nAnd last but not least, <em>Devil in a blue dress</em>. My friend Al turned me on to\nthis, and I&rsquo;m so glad he did. This is L.A. Confidential from the\nAfrican-American perspective. It&rsquo;s a great detective story, it&rsquo;s so well\nwritten, and it&rsquo;s an approach to race that, although written in the early 90s,\nreads just as fresh in 2024.</p>\n<p>A couple of thoughts to close. First, almost all\nnon-fiction I consumed this year was listened. I&rsquo;d love to have the brightness\nand mental capacity to spend 40 minutes every night getting lost in thorough\narguments. The truth is I don&rsquo;t. Instead, I do have about that time every\nnight when I wash the dishes and clean the kitchen. One day, in an ideal\nworld, I&rsquo;ll do all my reading, well, by reading. For what is worth, I do agree\nwith the snob argument that reading is a better way to engage with writing\nthan listening. It gives you more space to think and let the content change\nyou. It&rsquo;s just that such option is not in the cards right\nnow.\nSecond, I have tried to read as much from women as from men now for a few\nyears, with varying degrees of success. This year I think I was fairly OK with\nit. This year, it&rsquo;s almost been a perfect split between fiction (men) and\nnon-fiction (women). I need more female fiction\nrecommendations!\nAnd third, something I started this year is to systematically take notes and\nwrite down impressions as I was reading. I started towards the autumn, so I&rsquo;ll\nreserve conclusions on that for the future (including whether the practice\nsticks at all!).</p>\n<p>So, that&rsquo;s it, one more year. If you know me a bit, you know I like talking\nbooks, and I&rsquo;m <em>always</em> looking for more recommendations.

				"content_text": "It's that time of the year. [^1] Spotify just dropped Wrapped.\nThe lists of the best everything in 2024 start rolling on.\nAnd I can't help having a go at mine. [^2] One of the few practices I've kept over the years, even in the face of pretty\nsubstantial life style changes (e.g., baby) is reading. So, here's my list of\nbooks from 2024.\nLet's get all due caveats out of the way first of all. It's\ntechnically not a \"best of\" but rather \"all of\". I did not _love_ all the\nbooks in there, but I did read them. Unlike many smart people profess, I have a really hard time\ngiving up on a book I have started. This year though, I'm glad I stuck with all\nof them. Also, technically, I did not _read_ all of them either. A good chunk of\nthem I listened to while doing the dishes (more on this below). And, at the risk of stating the obvious, it's\nDecember 11th., the year has not ended. I'm currently on three books \n([one](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/144421737-what-if-we-get-it-right),\n[two](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40859000-delta-v),\n[three](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112976320-how-infrastructure-works?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=HAl0FKAfW5&rank=1))\nthat I might or not finnish before the year is out. All are very good.\nUnless something radical changes, none would replace my picks this year.\nSo, on we go.\n\nIf by best we mean a book that makes you stay up way too late reading, and you\nthink about long after you've finished, the clear winner this year is _The\nDeluge_. It's hard to state in words how much I liked what is a 900p. book mostly\nabout climate change. Don't be fooled though, this is not the type of\nsci/cli-fi where characters and story are simple vehicles for the Big Ideas.\nThere are lots of those (Big Ideas), but there are also real characters.\nPeople you come to love, despise, and find uncomfortably close to you. Since I\nfinished it, I've been looking for someone, anyone, who's read it too and is\nup for a coffee, because there are so many bits I'd like to discuss with\nanother human about this book. Unfortunately though, the search goes on...\n\nThe other book that surprised me in many and good ways was _Doppelganger_.\nI'm the proud owner of a 1,999 paper copy of NoLogo, which I devoured as a\nhighschool student. After that, I figured there would be little in Naomi\nKlein's writing I wouldn't agree with or would change my views, so did not\nread more. How wrong I was. Admittedly, this is the most and least Klein book\nI can think of. It is something only her could have written and only now,\nafter decades of craft. And is a really hard book to pull off. It's about so\nmany things (her confusion with Naomi Wolf, conspiracy theories, right-wing\npolitics in the XXIst Century, doppelgangers in culture and art over history,\nJewish identity...) that it is hard to classify or even summarise. But it's\nwell worth your time. Go read (listen to) it.\n\nHonorary mentions. This has been a good year for reads. It's also been a\nterrible year in many personal aspects of my life. In the worst of it in May,\nI picked up _Where there's a will_, and I'm so glad I did. Chappell's account\nof what it really means to win a race so brutal like the Transcontinental is\neverything I needed to read about human endurance, empathy, and\nhumbleness.\n_Impossible people_ was also a phenomenal (graphic) read. Wertz's account of\nher own alcoholism is so raw, hopeful, and just pure\nfunny.\nAnd last but not least, _Devil in a blue dress_. My friend Al turned me on to\nthis, and I'm so glad he did. This is L.A. Confidential from the\nAfrican-American perspective. It's a great detective story, it's so well\nwritten, and it's an approach to race that, although written in the early 90s,\nreads just as fresh in 2024.\n\nA couple of thoughts to close. First, almost all\nnon-fiction I consumed this year was listened. I'd love to have the brightness\nand mental capacity to spend 40 minutes every night getting lost in thorough\narguments. The truth is I don't. Instead, I do have about that time every\nnight when I wash the dishes and clean the kitchen. One day, in an ideal\nworld, I'll do all my reading, well, by reading.

I started towards the autumn, so I'll\nreserve conclusions on that for the future (including whether the practice\nsticks at all!).\n\nSo, that's it, one more year.
