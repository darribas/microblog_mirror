All are very good.\nUnless something radical changes, none would replace my picks this year.\nSo, on we go.</p>\n<p>If by best we mean a book that makes you stay up way too late reading, and you\nthink about long after you&rsquo;ve finished, the clear winner this year is <em>The\nDeluge</em>. It&rsquo;s hard to state in words how much I liked what is a 900p. book mostly\nabout climate change. Don&rsquo;t be fooled though, this is not the type of\nsci/cli-fi where characters and story are simple vehicles for the Big Ideas.\nThere are lots of those (Big Ideas), but there are also real characters.\nPeople you come to love, despise, and find uncomfortably close to you.

Unfortunately though, the search goes on&hellip;</p>\n<p>The other book that surprised me in many and good ways was <em>Doppelganger</em>.\nI&rsquo;m the proud owner of a 1,999 paper copy of NoLogo, which I devoured as a\nhighschool student. After that, I figured there would be little in Naomi\nKlein&rsquo;s writing I wouldn&rsquo;t agree with or would change my views, so did not\nread more. How wrong I was. Admittedly, this is the most and least Klein book\nI can think of. It is something only her could have written and only now,\nafter decades of craft. And is a really hard book to pull off. It&rsquo;s about so\nmany things (her confusion with Naomi Wolf, conspiracy theories, right-wing\npolitics in the XXIst Century, doppelgangers in culture and art over history,\nJewish identity&hellip;) that it is hard to classify or even summarise. But it&rsquo;s\nwell worth your time. Go read (listen to) it.</p>\n<p>Honorary mentions. This has been a good year for reads. It&rsquo;s also been a\nterrible year in many personal aspects of my life. In the worst of it in May,\nI picked up <em>Where there&rsquo;s a will</em>, and I&rsquo;m so glad I did. Chappell&rsquo;s account\nof what it really means to win a race so brutal like the Transcontinental is\neverything I needed to read about human endurance, empathy, and\nhumbleness.\n<em>Impossible people</em> was also a phenomenal (graphic) read.

First, almost all\nnon-fiction I consumed this year was listened. I&rsquo;d love to have the brightness\nand mental capacity to spend 40 minutes every night getting lost in thorough\narguments. The truth is I don&rsquo;t. Instead, I do have about that time every\nnight when I wash the dishes and clean the kitchen. One day, in an ideal\nworld, I&rsquo;ll do all my reading, well, by reading. For what is worth, I do agree\nwith the snob argument that reading is a better way to engage with writing\nthan listening. It gives you more space to think and let the content change\nyou. It&rsquo;s just that such option is not in the cards right\nnow.\nSecond, I have tried to read as much from women as from men now for a few\nyears, with varying degrees of success. This year I think I was fairly OK with\nit. This year, it&rsquo;s almost been a perfect split between fiction (men) and\nnon-fiction (women). I need more female fiction\nrecommendations!\nAnd third, something I started this year is to systematically take notes and\nwrite down impressions as I was reading. I started towards the autumn, so I&rsquo;ll\nreserve conclusions on that for the future (including whether the practice\nsticks at all!).</p>\n<p>So, that&rsquo;s it, one more year. If you know me a bit, you know I like talking\nbooks, and I&rsquo;m <em>always</em> looking for more recommendations.

The work builds on our earlier contribution to the National Land Data Programme<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> last year, and the document puts in writing much of what we <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/geospatial-commission-funded-tool-demonstrates-potential-for-ai-to-transform-decisions-about-land-use\">presented to the minister for AI and intellectual property</a> last March. There is also an accompanying <a href=\"https://geospatialcommission.blog.gov.uk/2024/11/14/how-geospatial-ai-can-help-inform-our-land-use-choices/\">blog post</a> Mehul and his team at the Commission put out.</p>\n<p>Most of the report is a summary of what we learned in two specific\nexercises and a series of engagement events. I&rsquo;ll give you the two-sentence version of each here but, if you are interested, you really should grab the report as it covers them much more comprehensively.\nIn one, we took our initial <a href=\"https://urban-analytics-technology-platform.github.io/demoland-web/tyne_and_wear_hex/#10.06/55.1137/-1.5308\">DemoLand app</a>, a tool that helps users explore different land use scenarios and their effect on areas such as air quality or house prices, and embedded a chat interface powered by a large language model. The original tool provided access to a lot of data and modelling that would be hard to access for non-technical audiences otherwise, but it still required the user to &ldquo;know their way around&rdquo;. With the new chat-based interface, exploring the results is a much more conversational experience that can reach larger even audiences.\nIn the second exercise, we digged into the guts of the models that power land\nuse applications such as those in DemoLand. Typically, many of these require\ndata that is collected and released more slowly than ideally required for\ndecision making (e.g., Census or building cadasters). We explored\ncomplementing, or even replacing, these by widely available satellite imagery.\nSatellite data is definitely not a new thing, we&rsquo;ve had metal boxes orbitting\nthe Earth since at least the 1950s, but there are a few <em>recent</em> things that\nmake them more appealing. The revolution in computer vision (and what is now\nalso termed AI) we have seen in the last 15 years has changed what we are able\nto do with imagery, even that of limited spatial resolution. In this exercise,\nwe explore foundation models for vision (a bit like the GPT in ChatGPT but for\nsatellite data) to see how far we could push them. The result is a series of\nwhat I consider extremely exciting results but others might see as largely dry\nperformance scores tables. You can get a summary of those in the report.\nIn addition to these two exercises, we also ran consultation events (at <a href=\"https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/ai-uk-2024\">AI\nUK'24</a> and online) with experts to\nget a broader view on the potential, challenges and immediate opportunities of\ngeospatial AI for land use. I could summarise those, but I won&rsquo;t do a better\njob than the report, so head over to its &ldquo;Section 3&rdquo; for that.</p>\n<p>What will probably (I hope!) catch most attention is the &ldquo;Recommendations&rdquo;\nsection. Here is where we brought together everything we learnt in these\nexercises to propose concrete steps forward. In particular, we mention five:</p>\n<p>1/ Identify additional areas of opportunity for satellite data to build the value case for geospatial AI.</p>\n<p>2/ Develop a Geospatial AI Toolkit for LLMs.</p>\n<p>3/ Expand the conversation on national foundation models to land use and geospatial.</p>\n<p>4/ Improve access to key computational and data resources.</p>\n<p>5/ Promote knowledge sharing and cross-discipline collaboratio.</p>\n<p>Some are self-explanatory and I suspect few will disagree with them (who is\nagainst more knowledge sharing?). Others bring to the front\ndiscussions that we think deserve more attention than they&rsquo;re currently\nreceiving. LLMs, for example, are not very good at geography (there is a\nreason why the second L is not a G!). Before we jump in and take them\noff-the-self, we think there is work to do to develop the &ldquo;Geography\ncurriculum&rdquo; we&rsquo;d like these models to know when they help folks on\nspatial domains. And others seem more obvious than they actually are.\nSuggesting in 2024 that satellite data be used for land use change may cause\nunreparable eye-rolls among land use experts who&rsquo;ve been doing this in an\nacademic context for several decades. Yet there is still very little of it\nthat has made it into &ldquo;production&rdquo; at scale, particularly in non environmental\nand physical domains such as cities and society<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup>. So think twice before sending your eyes upwards.</p>\n<p>Above all, and ironically given that it summarises past work, we hope this becomes a conversation starter. There is so much exciting stuff that is happening in the world of AI that could have tremendous implications for land use modelling and management. <em>What</em> exactly and, specially, <em>how</em> are debates we have just begun and are far from done. But we think they are worth having <em>and</em> actioning on.

Blog post from the Geospatial Commission on the report - [`URL`](https://geospatialcommission.blog.gov.uk/2024/11/14/how-geospatial-ai-can-help-inform-our-land-use-choices/)\n\nTODAY, the [Geospatial Commission](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/geospatial-commission) released the [report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/geospatial-ai-for-land-use-by-the-alan-turing-institute/geospatial-ai-for-land-use-by-the-alan-turing-institute) we[^1] prepared for a project we have been working over the last year in collaboration with them. The work builds on our earlier contribution to the National Land Data Programme[^2] last year, and the document puts in writing much of what we [presented to the minister for AI and intellectual property](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/geospatial-commission-funded-tool-demonstrates-potential-for-ai-to-transform-decisions-about-land-use) last March. There is also an accompanying [blog post](https://geospatialcommission.blog.gov.uk/2024/11/14/how-geospatial-ai-can-help-inform-our-land-use-choices/) Mehul and his team at the Commission put out.\n\nMost of the report is a summary of what we learned in two specific\nexercises and a series of engagement events. I'll give you the two-sentence version of each here but, if you are interested, you really should grab the report as it covers them much more comprehensively.\nIn one, we took our initial [DemoLand app](https://urban-analytics-technology-platform.github.io/demoland-web/tyne_and_wear_hex/#10.06/55.1137/-1.5308), a tool that helps users explore different land use scenarios and their effect on areas such as air quality or house prices, and embedded a chat interface powered by a large language model. The original tool provided access to a lot of data and modelling that would be hard to access for non-technical audiences otherwise, but it still required the user to \"know their way around\". With the new chat-based interface, exploring the results is a much more conversational experience that can reach larger even audiences.\nIn the second exercise, we digged into the guts of the models that power land\nuse applications such as those in DemoLand. Typically, many of these require\ndata that is collected and released more slowly than ideally required for\ndecision making (e.g., Census or building cadasters). We explored\ncomplementing, or even replacing, these by widely available satellite imagery.\nSatellite data is definitely not a new thing, we've had metal boxes orbitting\nthe Earth since at least the 1950s, but there are a few _recent_ things that\nmake them more appealing. The revolution in computer vision (and what is now\nalso termed AI) we have seen in the last 15 years has changed what we are able\nto do with imagery, even that of limited spatial resolution. In this exercise,\nwe explore foundation models for vision (a bit like the GPT in ChatGPT but for\nsatellite data) to see how far we could push them. The result is a series of\nwhat I consider extremely exciting results but others might see as largely dry\nperformance scores tables. You can get a summary of those in the report.\nIn addition to these two exercises, we also ran consultation events (at [AI\nUK'24](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/ai-uk-2024) and online) with experts to\nget a broader view on the potential, challenges and immediate opportunities of\ngeospatial AI for land use. I could summarise those, but I won't do a better\njob than the report, so head over to its \"Section 3\" for that.\n\nWhat will probably (I hope!) catch most attention is the \"Recommendations\"\nsection. Here is where we brought together everything we learnt in these\nexercises to propose concrete steps forward. In particular, we mention five:\n\n1/ Identify additional areas of opportunity for satellite data to build the value case for geospatial AI.\n\n2/ Develop a Geospatial AI Toolkit for LLMs.\n\n3/ Expand the conversation on national foundation models to land use and geospatial.\n\n4/ Improve access to key computational and data resources.\n\n5/ Promote knowledge sharing and cross-discipline collaboratio.\n\nSome are self-explanatory and I suspect few will disagree with them (who is\nagainst more knowledge sharing?). Others bring to the front\ndiscussions that we think deserve more attention than they're currently\nreceiving. LLMs, for example, are not very good at geography (there is a\nreason why the second L is not a G!). Before we jump in and take them\noff-the-self, we think there is work to do to develop the \"Geography\ncurriculum\" we'd like these models to know when they help folks on\nspatial domains. And others seem more obvious than they actually are.\nSuggesting in 2024 that satellite data be used for land use change may cause\nunreparable eye-rolls among land use experts who've been doing this in an\nacademic context for several decades. Yet there is still very little of it\nthat has made it into \"production\" at scale, particularly in non environmental\nand physical domains such as cities and society[^3]. So think twice before sending your eyes upwards.\n\nAbove all, and ironically given that it summarises past work, we hope this becomes a conversation starter. There is so much exciting stuff that is happening in the world of AI that could have tremendous implications for land use modelling and management. _What_ exactly and, specially, _how_ are debates we have just begun and are far from done. But we think they are worth having _and_ actioning on. To work.\n\n[^1]: The team on this project spanned folks at the Commission and Urban Analytics@Turing. At Turing, Barbara Metzler and Stuart Lynn did most of the heavy lifting, and I was the lucky one to \"see early demos and present it around\".\n\n[^2]: Geospatial Commission (2023). *Finding common ground: Integrating data, science and innovation for better use of land* - [URL](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/finding-common-ground-integrating-data-science-and-innovation-for-better-use-of-land)\n\n[^3]: This is one\nof the core ideas that made [Imago](https://www.sdruk.ukri.org/2024/10/17/22-million-for-new-smart-data-services/) a winning proposition, so watch this space.\n",
