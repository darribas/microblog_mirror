				"title": "The case for satellite imagery in social science and policymaking: A sketch from my talks in China",
				"content_html": "<p>Last week I came back from ten days in China on a research project. It was a whirlwind tour with five cities, and lots of opportunities to interact with both the, academic and otherwise, Chinese world. It was fascinating. At many levels, it felt like a peek into the future.</p>\n<p>As part of the trip, I had the opportunity to give two talks, one at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in Beijing and another at Southwest University in Chongqing. Both were titled &ldquo;<em>Making satellite imagery more useful, usable, and used in Social Science and policymaking</em>&rdquo;, and both had a very similar structure. The CAS talk was a bit longer, and it allowed me to illustrate practically many of the ideas I talked about in the first part using our ongoing <a href=\"https://github.com/eurofab-project\">EuroFab</a>. Here I want to focus on the more conceptual bit, which aligns very much with the motivation behind <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/sdr-imago/\">Imago</a>.</p>\n<p>The talk tries to build the case for paying more attention and interest to satellite imagery as a source of data and information in the context of social science and policymaking. I structured this argument in four acts<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>: the value proposition, the promise, the reason, and the gap.</p>\n<p>Start with the value proposition. We&rsquo;re at the confluence of three trends that make this a unique moment to look at satellite imagery with &ldquo;untraditional&rdquo; eyes. One, there&rsquo;s never been more and better satellite(s and) imagery available. Launching stuff into space is becoming dramatically cheaper than it used to be. As Econ 101 would predict, you lower the price of something, more of that is bought, and we have more and more satellites being placed on orbit (<em>more data</em>). These are also benefitting from the revolution in consumer electronics of the last few decades, so the sensors on board are able to capture much more than before (<em>better data</em>). Second, we have better ways of extracting information from such imagery. Images contain a lot of useful information but it&rsquo;s all encoded in pixels that don&rsquo;t mean anything in themselves. To make something useful, you need a &ldquo;magic decoder&rdquo; that turns pixels into buildings, roads, land uses, etc. Well, the last fifteen years of progress in computer vision have delivered just that. From the first deep learning models of the early 2010s, into the more advanced neural nets of the end of the decade to contemporary foundation models for vision, how we teach computers to see things has undergone nothing short of a revolution. And third, which seems less relevant but it&rsquo;s the piece that makes it all possible, the technology stack required to access such algorithms and operate on such data has been dramatically democratised. Compute is cheap(ish) and software is free(ish). It&rsquo;s a brave new world.</p>\n<p>Now the promise. What the confluence of the three trends above means for social researchers and policymakers is we can now do at least two things we couldn&rsquo;t before. One, to measure things we haven&rsquo;t been able to measure (at scale); and two, to measure better, sooner and/or more often things we&rsquo;re now measuring slowly, late and sparsely. Both are, in some ways, the two sides of the same coin. They capture how the same &ldquo;opening up&rdquo; of new sources of information affect different status quo. In some cases (e.g., temperature, air quality, certain features of the built environment such as solar panel installations), we have not been able to measure certain phenomena that are relevant for social processes at the scale and detail required to consider them seriously in our work. In others, we do have a current solution, but it is lacking in many ways and we use it because it&rsquo;s better than nothing, not because it&rsquo;s good. For many of these cases, I think satellite imagery is poised to redefine what we consider acceptable for data feeding into research and policy.</p>\n<p>Why, beyond &ldquo;just because we can&rdquo;, <em>should</em> we try to realise such promise? The short version is we&rsquo;ve never needed new, timely and accurate data more than now. The world is becoming more unstable and unpredictable (e.g., climate change, spatial inequalities). We can&rsquo;t &ldquo;wait for the next Census&rdquo; (which might not even happen in some places!) to know how society and the built environment are changing. Decisions need to be made before then and, for those to be meaningful, there&rsquo;s a whole lot of understanding we need to unlock first. And, by the way, this is not a clash between traditional sources of data like the Census and newer ones like satellites. We need both of them, separately, but particularly in tandem: satellites can &ldquo;stretch&rdquo; the value of Censuses by, for example, providing additional context; and most of the value held by imagery relies almost entirely on our ability to relate them to existing measurements of phenomena we want, of labels. Our best shot at that &ldquo;labelling&rdquo; in the social realm are traditional sources.</p>\n<p>And, finally, why <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> we already realising this promise? This is what I called The Gap. Again, three main reasons in my view. One, imagery is <em>big</em>. If nothing else, there is a lot of it and it takes a lot of space on storage disks. To a point that changes how you have to think about working with it (this is the &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t fit in your laptop&rdquo; problem). Two, imagery is <em>hard</em>. The problem is not only that managing a large volume is challenging in itself, it&rsquo;s that it is also non-trivial to make something useful out of images. Something something, magic decoders, something, something. And, yes, these have become much more accessible, but it&rsquo;s still the case the science underpinning all of this is tricky. And, three, imagery is <em>different</em>. We don&rsquo;t train social scientists to work with images. Local government officers and government analysts don&rsquo;t know where to start to make sense of it all. This is in contrast to other disciplines where imagery is front and centre, their bread and butter. Social sciences have, for a long time, spent all of their training allowance on other skills and techniques that are fundamentally different.</p>\n<p>So that&rsquo;s it, my 20 minutes<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> to convince you are up.

Working Parties are a mostly internal affair where the different members of the OECD meet around specific topics to discuss progress, share experiences and coordinate. This is my second one, and they are a very interesting experience for an academic in that much of what is discussed is various forms of applied research, but the format and delivery is rather different than in a normal academic meeting.</p>\n<p>I contributed a ten minute talk on geospatial AI for land use, and I thought I&rsquo;d summarise here what I presented.

				"content_text": "Last week, I contributed to the OECD's 48th session of the Working Party on Territorial Indicators. Working Parties are a mostly internal affair where the different members of the OECD meet around specific topics to discuss progress, share experiences and coordinate. This is my second one, and they are a very interesting experience for an academic in that much of what is discussed is various forms of applied research, but the format and delivery is rather different than in a normal academic meeting. \n\nI contributed a ten minute talk on geospatial AI for land use, and I thought I'd summarise here what I presented. I labelled it as an \"opinionated version of our [recent report on the topic](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/geospatial-ai-for-land-use-by-the-alan-turing-institute/geospatial-ai-for-land-use-by-the-alan-turing-institute)\", and I stand by that definition. I tried to give an overview of the opportunities I see for (geospatial) AI to support the understanding, modelling and management of land use. Much of what I said is in the report (possibly in a slightly more eloquent and formal way), but I also mixed in some of the lessons we've learnt from our ongoing [EuroFab](https://github.com/eurofab-project) project with OECD, Charles University and ESA.\n\nTo me, these are the three areas where (geospatial) AI intersects with land use:\n\n- More data\n- Better modelling\n- More intuitive interfaces\n\nStart with data. Much of what modern AI/ML does is making data that traditionally were beyond the realm of computation, computable. Think of text, audio, or images. These are all sources of (unstructured) information that land use experts have only been able to access in a qualitative and manual way.

Data in themselves are not information, insight, or knowledge. The bridge between them is often modelling. Modelling in land use is of course not new. But new advances in AI/ML are giving it a notable boost. We can both make better models with traditional data (e.g., a lot of the tree-based algorithms like random forests and XGBoost have revolutionised making predictions with structured data) _and_ expand such models to accommodate the sources of data I mention above in a native way. In land use, this is also a pretty big advancement. Think of the full-fledged industry of land use regression models, where different outcomes (e.g., air quality, land use change) is explained as a function of land use characteristics.

Much of the land discussion (be it on modelling, understanding or affecting it through policy) is focused on &ldquo;most of the land&rdquo;. This makes sense to a certain extent. After all, cities are about 5% of the land. However, if we&rsquo;re serious about curving emissions and building a better home for most of the population, this 5% clearly punches above its weight (e.g., about 75% emissions come from cities whom, in a country like the UK, house about 80% of the population).</li>\n</ol>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>This is in part why we launched <a href=\"https://imago.ac.uk\">Imago</a>, to bring all this good stuff to the social sciences, public health, and policymaking arenas.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n",

For example, and I may be biased here, the single most exciting development of the last ten years is the ability to make increasingly more abundant imagery from satellites _computable_ so it can feed into these decisions.[^1]\n\nGiven the prompt to talk about \"how it could work\", I gave a shout to our [DemoLand](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/demoland) project, as an illustration of how to combine data and AI to support land use decisions.\n\nI closed the intervention with an afterword, two points I really wanted to make but couldn't elegantly squeeze in the previous part:\n\n1. Data (as well as the models and, eventually, digital twins they feed into) are best thought of as human augmentation rather than replacement. As much as some might like it that way, I _don't_ think any of this is about the robots taking over the job of the planners, it's about super-charging planners!\n2. _Urban land is land!_ This is by now one of my hobby horses. Much of the land discussion (be it on modelling, understanding or affecting it through policy) is focused on \"most of the land\". This makes sense to a certain extent. After all, cities are about 5% of the land. However, if we're serious about curving emissions and building a better home for most of the population, this 5% clearly punches above its weight (e.g., about 75% emissions come from cities whom, in a country like the UK, house about 80% of the population).\n\n[^1]: This is in part why we launched [Imago](https://imago.ac.uk), to bring all this good stuff to the social sciences, public health, and policymaking arenas.\n",

After that, I figured there would be little in Naomi\nKlein&rsquo;s writing I wouldn&rsquo;t agree with or would change my views, so did not\nread more. How wrong I was. Admittedly, this is the most and least Klein book\nI can think of. It is something only her could have written and only now,\nafter decades of craft. And is a really hard book to pull off. It&rsquo;s about so\nmany things (her confusion with Naomi Wolf, conspiracy theories, right-wing\npolitics in the XXIst Century, doppelgangers in culture and art over history,\nJewish identity&hellip;) that it is hard to classify or even summarise.

Chappell&rsquo;s account\nof what it really means to win a race so brutal like the Transcontinental is\neverything I needed to read about human endurance, empathy, and\nhumbleness.\n<em>Impossible people</em> was also a phenomenal (graphic) read.

First, almost all\nnon-fiction I consumed this year was listened. I&rsquo;d love to have the brightness\nand mental capacity to spend 40 minutes every night getting lost in thorough\narguments. The truth is I don&rsquo;t. Instead, I do have about that time every\nnight when I wash the dishes and clean the kitchen. One day, in an ideal\nworld, I&rsquo;ll do all my reading, well, by reading. For what is worth, I do agree\nwith the snob argument that reading is a better way to engage with writing\nthan listening. It gives you more space to think and let the content change\nyou. It&rsquo;s just that such option is not in the cards right\nnow.\nSecond, I have tried to read as much from women as from men now for a few\nyears, with varying degrees of success. This year I think I was fairly OK with\nit. This year, it&rsquo;s almost been a perfect split between fiction (men) and\nnon-fiction (women). I need more female fiction\nrecommendations!\nAnd third, something I started this year is to systematically take notes and\nwrite down impressions as I was reading. I started towards the autumn, so I&rsquo;ll\nreserve conclusions on that for the future (including whether the practice\nsticks at all!).</p>\n<p>So, that&rsquo;s it, one more year.

So feel free to hit\nme up with books that have made your 2024 a better tour around the sun!\n\n## Books of 2024\n\n### Non-fiction\n\n- [_Where There's a Will: Hope, Grief and Endurance in a Cycle Race Across a Continent_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46260674-where-there-s-a-will), Emily Chappell.\n- [_Impossible People_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62315670-impossible-people).

I’m reluctant to pay much attention to it because a) it counts my two dropped books as read and b) because… Goodreads. It’s 2024, your service is no better than in 2014. Most frustratingly, it could be sooo much better. Oh well, digression…\n",

The original tool provided access to a lot of data and modelling that would be hard to access for non-technical audiences otherwise, but it still required the user to &ldquo;know their way around&rdquo;.
