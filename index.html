<blockquote>
<p>However, as we demonstrate analytically, reliance on ChatGPT for idea generation comes with a trade-off: while enhancing individual ideas’ creativity, it reduces the diversity of ideas in a pool of ideas—a critical element for effective brainstorming.</p>

<p>This is a very interesting one, where a standard (CORINE) classification is mimicked with OSM where enough good data is available, and then sparser areas are filled in with satellite data and standard ResNet’s. A useful pattern that’d be interesting to see if it works in less standard setups as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Given the fragmented availability of OSM data and opportunistic availability of thematic content and depth, resulting LULC products are consequently incomplete in terms of spatial coverage.

<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of good stuff here. The thing that stuck with me was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>global urban extent has expanded by 9,687 km2 per year. This rate is four times greater than previous reputable estimates from worldwide individual cities, suggesting an unprecedented rate of global urbanization. The rate of urban expansion is notably faster than that of population growth</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This one also struck a cord:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the global urban extent increased from 362,747 km2 to 653,354 km2 from 1985 to 2015, representing a net expansion of 80% [&hellip;] During the same period (1985–2015), data from the United Nations show that urban population, an essential driver of urban area expansion, increased by 52% [&hellip;] Thus, much of the newly developed urban lands were not used for housing but for other purposes (for example, commercial and industrial districts).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure the last sentence follows from the previous ones. The economist in me probably thinks people consume more land per head (i.e., bigger houses, bigger plots, bigger cars that require bigger lanes). But, as they say, this is an empirical question&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>our understanding of how cities change in space and over time is limited by the lack of spatially and temporally comprehensive urban land cover data at a high resolution<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-0521-x#ref-CR6">6</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-0521-x#ref-CR7">7</a>. Development of this information lags behind that of state-of-the-art non-urban landcover change data</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The current understanding of urban growth is largely based on demographic (population) data rather than information describing the spatial and temporal patterns of urban land-cover change.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>we defined the extent of urbanized land between 1985 and 2015 by fusing four available global urban-extent maps with similar spatial resolutions for 1985 and 2015 (that is, the Global Human Settlement Layer<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-0521-x#ref-CR6">6</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-0521-x#ref-CR19">19</a>, the Global Urban Footprint<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-0521-x#ref-CR20">20</a>, the Global Urban Land <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-0521-x#ref-CR7">7</a> and the Global Artificial Impervious Area<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-0521-x#ref-CR16">16</a>; Supplementary Table <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-0521-x#MOESM1">1</a>). We extracted cells from the two fusion maps that changed from non-urban in 1985 to urban in 2015. We then used an annual time series (1985–2015) of the normalized urban areas composite index (NUACI) to detect the year of urbanization and green recovery (vegetative regrowth or new plantings in built environments) for each pixel within this urbanized extent. Finally, we assessed the accuracy of all derived products over the past three decades
Note: Approach
the fused GAUD global urban extent maps are robust across different urban ecoregions and have relatively high mean accuracy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Better accuracy is mainly attributed to (1) our GAUD data having urban regions that are consistent in different urban products and (2) inconsistent regions being reclassified using a locally adaptive random forest classifier.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the global urban extent increased from 362,747 km2 to 653,354 km2 from 1985 to 2015, representing a net expansion of 80%</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>During the same period (1985–2015), data from the United Nations show that urban population, an essential driver of urban area expansion, increased by 52%</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the rates of urbanization in Asia, Africa and South America accelerated during the 30 yr period but began to slow in North America, Europe and Australia</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the bulk (~70%) of urban growth since 1992 occurred at the expense of agricultural land, followed by grasslands (~12%) and forests (~9%)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the dataset can be used to improve our understanding of how urban areas affect carbon cycles, a negative anthropogenic impact that has not been studied thoroughly<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-0521-x#ref-CR30">30</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-0521-x#ref-CR31">31</a> because of the lack of accurate and continuous global urban extent maps. The GAUD data can also be used to study how urban expansion drives global changes in energy and water use and in turn triggers changes in water and energy fluxes between the land and atmosphere<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-0521-x#ref-CR25">25</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-0521-x#ref-CR32">32</a>. GAUD may also aid research into the impacts of rapid urban expansion on habitat and biodiversity loss or the extent that health risks arise from urban heat island effects.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last week, I contributed to the OECD&rsquo;s 48th session of the Working Party on Territorial Indicators. Working Parties are a mostly internal affair where the different members of the OECD meet around specific topics to discuss progress, share experiences and coordinate. This is my second one, and they are a very interesting experience for an academic in that much of what is discussed is various forms of applied research, but the format and delivery is rather different than in a normal academic meeting.</p>
<p>I contributed a ten minute talk on geospatial AI for land use, and I thought I&rsquo;d summarise here what I presented. I labelled it as an &ldquo;opinionated version of our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/geospatial-ai-for-land-use-by-the-alan-turing-institute/geospatial-ai-for-land-use-by-the-alan-turing-institute">recent report on the topic</a>&rdquo;, and I stand by that definition. I tried to give an overview of the opportunities I see for (geospatial) AI to support the understanding, modelling and management of land use. Much of what I said is in the report (possibly in a slightly more eloquent and formal way), but I also mixed in some of the lessons we&rsquo;ve learnt from our ongoing <a href="https://github.com/eurofab-project">EuroFab</a> project with OECD, Charles University and ESA.</p>
<p>To me, these are the three areas where (geospatial) AI intersects with land use:</p>
<ul>
<li>More data</li>
<li>Better modelling</li>
<li>More intuitive interfaces</li>
</ul>
<p>Start with data. Much of what modern AI/ML does is making data that traditionally were beyond the realm of computation, computable. Think of text, audio, or images. These are all sources of (unstructured) information that land use experts have only been able to access in a qualitative and manual way. Modern techniques such as foundation models for both text (LLMs) and image make it possible to treat these sources as quantitative data. And this is a big deal. Think of the amount of imagery that is coming from satellites, or how much data about, say, the planning system is locked in PDFs and word documents. Making these as accessible as a Census table will bring new sources on which to base evidence in a more timely fashion.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s modelling. Data in themselves are not information, insight, or knowledge. The bridge between them is often modelling. Modelling in land use is of course not new. But new advances in AI/ML are giving it a notable boost. We can both make better models with traditional data (e.g., a lot of the tree-based algorithms like random forests and XGBoost have revolutionised making predictions with structured data) <em>and</em> expand such models to accommodate the sources of data I mention above in a native way. In land use, this is also a pretty big advancement. Think of the full-fledged industry of land use regression models, where different outcomes (e.g., air quality, land use change) is explained as a function of land use characteristics. How that function is modelled and how land use is characterised/measured is poised to radically change in the coming years.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;re interfaces. How much effect and impact the results from the modelling exercises in the previous paragraph can have is mediated by how they are presented and made available to the public. It&rsquo;s 2025, so I don&rsquo;t have to spend many words on how modern (Gen)AI is revolutionising human-computer interfaces. An example of how this could pan out is the chatbot interface we built on top of our DemoLand tool for exploring urban land use scenarios and that features in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/geospatial-ai-for-land-use-by-the-alan-turing-institute/geospatial-ai-for-land-use-by-the-alan-turing-institute#section-2-broadening-the-audience">Section 2</a> of the report. This is of course not an area specific to land use, but I think land use is a good candidate to benefit particularly from this trend. The outputs from land use modelling are usually sophisticated and non-trivial to understand. At the same time, if we want them to have an effect, they <em>need</em> to be understood by non-technical folks such as policy makers, practitioners and the general public.</p>
<p>And that, pretty much, covered my ten minutes! It was fun to think of how to present results from our research to folks who are not academics but deeply care about the topic. This year, I had to participate online, but I hope I have future opportunities to come in person and meet participants over coffee breaks (or even during the timetabled cocktail!).</p>

<p>There’s so much interesting stuff on this piece, it puts a lot of “tangible” into this new way of software engineering. Interestingly, I don’t know how much this workflow translates into data science, where one often needs to get deep into coding to be able to fully define it (aka write a good prompt). But, paraphrasing this piece, maybe this is me being a bit of a “boomer data scientist”…</p>

<p>new technologies are now invented so quickly that it is no longer useful to separate them out from one another. They crowd into each other, disrupting what already exists, only for many of them to come back to regenerate and rekindle what has already been invented.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These systems are moving science from being theory-led to data-led, from deduction to induction, although this does not mean that theory is being dispensed with, only that new ideas can emerge and converge from any or both of these directions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>generative AI is uniquely suited to designing solutions which improve the human condition, in our own case the quality of life, the sustainability and the prosperity associated with cities. In a previous editorial (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/23998083251332093?mi=ehikzz#bibr3-23998083251332093">Batty, 2024b</a>), I sketched out how generative AI was an early theme in the development of configurational statistics, shape grammars, design methods, pattern languages, and related optimisation models which we published in this journal. In fact, this is likely to herald a revival in ideas about design coming from this area in the next decade.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the trouble with trying to continually narrow the definitions of “free” is that it is impossible to write a license that will perfectly prohibit each possibility that makes a person go “wait, no, not like that” while retaining the benefits of free and open access.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Often by trying to wall off those considered to be bad actors, people wall off the very people they intended to give access to.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The true threat from AI models training on open access material is not that more people may access knowledge thanks to new modalities. It’s that those models may stifle Wikipedia and other free knowledge repositories, benefiting from the labor, money, and care that goes into supporting them while also bleeding them dry. It’s that trillion dollar companies become the sole arbiters of access to knowledge after subsuming the painstaking work of those who made knowledge free to all, killing those projects in the process.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just about strain on one individual project, it&rsquo;s about the systematic dismantling of the infrastructure that makes open knowledge possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead, we must ensure that mechanisms are in place to <em>force</em> AI companies to engage with these repositories on their creators' terms.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt6811">letter in Science</a> today from a bunch of well known remote sensing researchers that make the unusual point that modern satellite resolution is getting <em>too</em> good to be accurate for forest carbon estimation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>but this resolution (0.3-5m) is too high for mapping forest carbon. Forest carbon has a natural resolution constraint: the size of an individual tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great reminder that, sometimes, good spatial thinking trumps “better” technology. The insight applies much more widely than forest carbon estimation.</p>

<p>and secondly, the rule or relationship between the diverse patterns is unique with potential as a reflection to the cities' particular background and needs.</p>

<p>it is important to identify the scales of these patterns, whether the focus is on an overarching city blueprint or the intricate design of a specific neighbourhood</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Earlier this week, I participated in a [panel on the Land Use Framework](Edge Debate 179) at <a href="https://www.futurebuild.co.uk/">FutureBuild'25</a>. This was curated by <a href="https://edgedebate.com/">Edge</a>, and co-panelists included Baroness Young of Old Scone (Chair), Maya Singer Hobbs, Carolyn McKenzie, and Stephen Hill. Each of us spoke for 5-7minutes and then the chair opened for questions from the floor.</p>
<p>In my talk, titled &ldquo;Land use data to inform decision making - <em>How it could work</em>&rdquo;, I tried to make three clear points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Good decisions are linked to the “state” of land, and this is too complex to understand without direct evidence. (Good) data provide the context for (good) decisions.</li>
<li>We need data that changes &ldquo;at the speed of decisions&rdquo;. This context needs to reflect the current state of affairs, which changes much more rapidly than we have been able to gather data from  in the past.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a lot of <em>very cool</em> stuff happening in the world of data to support this view of the world. For example, and I may be biased here, the single most exciting development of the last ten years is the ability to make increasingly more abundant imagery from satellites <em>computable</em> so it can feed into these decisions.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>Given the prompt to talk about &ldquo;how it could work&rdquo;, I gave a shout to our <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/demoland">DemoLand</a> project, as an illustration of how to combine data and AI to support land use decisions.</p>
<p>I closed the intervention with an afterword, two points I really wanted to make but couldn&rsquo;t elegantly squeeze in the previous part:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data (as well as the models and, eventually, digital twins they feed into) are best thought of as human augmentation rather than replacement. As much as some might like it that way, I <em>don&rsquo;t</em> think any of this is about the robots taking over the job of the planners, it&rsquo;s about super-charging planners!</li>
<li><em>Urban land is land!</em> This is by now one of my hobby horses. Much of the land discussion (be it on modelling, understanding or affecting it through policy) is focused on &ldquo;most of the land&rdquo;. This makes sense to a certain extent. After all, cities are about 5% of the land. However, if we&rsquo;re serious about curving emissions and building a better home for most of the population, this 5% clearly punches above its weight (e.g., about 75% emissions come from cities whom, in a country like the UK, house about 80% of the population).</li>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s that time of the year. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Spotify just dropped Wrapped.
The lists of the best everything in 2024 start rolling on.
And I can&rsquo;t help having a go at mine. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> One of the few practices I&rsquo;ve kept over the years, even in the face of pretty
substantial life style changes (e.g., baby) is reading. So, here&rsquo;s my list of
books from 2024.
Let&rsquo;s get all due caveats out of the way first of all. It&rsquo;s
technically not a &ldquo;best of&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;all of&rdquo;. I did not <em>love</em> all the
books in there, but I did read them. Unlike many smart people profess, I have a really hard time
giving up on a book I have started. This year though, I&rsquo;m glad I stuck with all
of them. Also, technically, I did not <em>read</em> all of them either. A good chunk of
them I listened to while doing the dishes (more on this below). And, at the risk of stating the obvious, it&rsquo;s
December 11th., the year has not ended. I&rsquo;m currently on three books
(<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/144421737-what-if-we-get-it-right">one</a>,
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40859000-delta-v">two</a>,
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112976320-how-infrastructure-works?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=HAl0FKAfW5&amp;rank=1">three</a>)
that I might or not finnish before the year is out. All are very good.
Unless something radical changes, none would replace my picks this year.
So, on we go.</p>
<p>If by best we mean a book that makes you stay up way too late reading, and you
think about long after you&rsquo;ve finished, the clear winner this year is <em>The
Deluge</em>. It&rsquo;s hard to state in words how much I liked what is a 900p. book mostly
about climate change. Don&rsquo;t be fooled though, this is not the type of
sci/cli-fi where characters and story are simple vehicles for the Big Ideas.
There are lots of those (Big Ideas), but there are also real characters.
People you come to love, despise, and find uncomfortably close to you. Since I
finished it, I&rsquo;ve been looking for someone, anyone, who&rsquo;s read it too and is
up for a coffee, because there are so many bits I&rsquo;d like to discuss with
another human about this book. Unfortunately though, the search goes on&hellip;</p>
<p>The other book that surprised me in many and good ways was <em>Doppelganger</em>.
I&rsquo;m the proud owner of a 1,999 paper copy of NoLogo, which I devoured as a
highschool student. After that, I figured there would be little in Naomi
Klein&rsquo;s writing I wouldn&rsquo;t agree with or would change my views, so did not
read more. How wrong I was. Admittedly, this is the most and least Klein book
I can think of. It is something only her could have written and only now,
after decades of craft. And is a really hard book to pull off. It&rsquo;s about so
many things (her confusion with Naomi Wolf, conspiracy theories, right-wing
politics in the XXIst Century, doppelgangers in culture and art over history,
Jewish identity&hellip;) that it is hard to classify or even summarise. But it&rsquo;s
well worth your time. Go read (listen to) it.</p>
<p>Honorary mentions. This has been a good year for reads. It&rsquo;s also been a
terrible year in many personal aspects of my life. In the worst of it in May,
I picked up <em>Where there&rsquo;s a will</em>, and I&rsquo;m so glad I did. Chappell&rsquo;s account
of what it really means to win a race so brutal like the Transcontinental is
everything I needed to read about human endurance, empathy, and
humbleness.
<em>Impossible people</em> was also a phenomenal (graphic) read. Wertz&rsquo;s account of
her own alcoholism is so raw, hopeful, and just pure
funny.
And last but not least, <em>Devil in a blue dress</em>. My friend Al turned me on to
this, and I&rsquo;m so glad he did. This is L.A. Confidential from the
African-American perspective. It&rsquo;s a great detective story, it&rsquo;s so well
written, and it&rsquo;s an approach to race that, although written in the early 90s,
reads just as fresh in 2024.</p>
<p>A couple of thoughts to close. First, almost all
non-fiction I consumed this year was listened. I&rsquo;d love to have the brightness
and mental capacity to spend 40 minutes every night getting lost in thorough
arguments. The truth is I don&rsquo;t. Instead, I do have about that time every
night when I wash the dishes and clean the kitchen. One day, in an ideal
world, I&rsquo;ll do all my reading, well, by reading. For what is worth, I do agree
with the snob argument that reading is a better way to engage with writing
than listening. It gives you more space to think and let the content change
you. It&rsquo;s just that such option is not in the cards right
now.
Second, I have tried to read as much from women as from men now for a few
years, with varying degrees of success. This year I think I was fairly OK with
it. This year, it&rsquo;s almost been a perfect split between fiction (men) and
non-fiction (women). I need more female fiction
recommendations!
And third, something I started this year is to systematically take notes and
write down impressions as I was reading. I started towards the autumn, so I&rsquo;ll
reserve conclusions on that for the future (including whether the practice
sticks at all!).</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s it, one more year. If you know me a bit, you know I like talking
books, and I&rsquo;m <em>always</em> looking for more recommendations. So feel free to hit
me up with books that have made your 2024 a better tour around the sun!</p>

<p>TODAY, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/geospatial-commission">Geospatial Commission</a> released the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/geospatial-ai-for-land-use-by-the-alan-turing-institute/geospatial-ai-for-land-use-by-the-alan-turing-institute">report</a> we<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> prepared for a project we have been working over the last year in collaboration with them. The work builds on our earlier contribution to the National Land Data Programme<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> last year, and the document puts in writing much of what we <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/geospatial-commission-funded-tool-demonstrates-potential-for-ai-to-transform-decisions-about-land-use">presented to the minister for AI and intellectual property</a> last March. There is also an accompanying <a href="https://geospatialcommission.blog.gov.uk/2024/11/14/how-geospatial-ai-can-help-inform-our-land-use-choices/">blog post</a> Mehul and his team at the Commission put out.</p>
<p>Most of the report is a summary of what we learned in two specific
exercises and a series of engagement events. I&rsquo;ll give you the two-sentence version of each here but, if you are interested, you really should grab the report as it covers them much more comprehensively.
In one, we took our initial <a href="https://urban-analytics-technology-platform.github.io/demoland-web/tyne_and_wear_hex/#10.06/55.1137/-1.5308">DemoLand app</a>, a tool that helps users explore different land use scenarios and their effect on areas such as air quality or house prices, and embedded a chat interface powered by a large language model. The original tool provided access to a lot of data and modelling that would be hard to access for non-technical audiences otherwise, but it still required the user to &ldquo;know their way around&rdquo;. With the new chat-based interface, exploring the results is a much more conversational experience that can reach larger even audiences.
In the second exercise, we digged into the guts of the models that power land
use applications such as those in DemoLand. Typically, many of these require
data that is collected and released more slowly than ideally required for
decision making (e.g., Census or building cadasters). We explored
complementing, or even replacing, these by widely available satellite imagery.
Satellite data is definitely not a new thing, we&rsquo;ve had metal boxes orbitting
the Earth since at least the 1950s, but there are a few <em>recent</em> things that
make them more appealing. The revolution in computer vision (and what is now
also termed AI) we have seen in the last 15 years has changed what we are able
to do with imagery, even that of limited spatial resolution. In this exercise,
we explore foundation models for vision (a bit like the GPT in ChatGPT but for
satellite data) to see how far we could push them. The result is a series of
what I consider extremely exciting results but others might see as largely dry
performance scores tables. You can get a summary of those in the report.
In addition to these two exercises, we also ran consultation events (at <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/ai-uk-2024">AI
UK'24</a> and online) with experts to
get a broader view on the potential, challenges and immediate opportunities of
geospatial AI for land use. I could summarise those, but I won&rsquo;t do a better
job than the report, so head over to its &ldquo;Section 3&rdquo; for that.</p>
<p>What will probably (I hope!) catch most attention is the &ldquo;Recommendations&rdquo;
section. Here is where we brought together everything we learnt in these
exercises to propose concrete steps forward. In particular, we mention five:</p>
<p>1/ Identify additional areas of opportunity for satellite data to build the value case for geospatial AI.</p>
<p>2/ Develop a Geospatial AI Toolkit for LLMs.</p>
<p>3/ Expand the conversation on national foundation models to land use and geospatial.</p>
<p>4/ Improve access to key computational and data resources.</p>
<p>5/ Promote knowledge sharing and cross-discipline collaboration.</p>
<p>Some are self-explanatory and I suspect few will disagree with them (who is
against more knowledge sharing?). Others bring to the front
discussions that we think deserve more attention than they&rsquo;re currently
receiving. LLMs, for example, are not very good at geography (there is a
reason why the second L is not a G!). Before we jump in and take them
off-the-self, we think there is work to do to develop the &ldquo;Geography
curriculum&rdquo; we&rsquo;d like these models to know when they help folks on
spatial domains. And others seem more obvious than they actually are.
Suggesting in 2024 that satellite data be used for land use change may cause
unreparable eye-rolls among land use experts who&rsquo;ve been doing this in an
academic context for several decades. Yet there is still very little of it
that has made it into &ldquo;production&rdquo; at scale, particularly in non environmental
and physical domains such as cities and society<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. So think twice before sending your eyes upwards.</p>
<p>Above all, and ironically given that it summarises past work, we hope this becomes a conversation starter. There is so much exciting stuff that is happening in the world of AI that could have tremendous implications for land use modelling and management. <em>What</em> exactly and, specially, <em>how</em> are debates we have just begun and are far from done. But we think they are worth having <em>and</em> actioning on. To work.</p>

			 <p>âThat&rsquo;s what we are, we humans âcreatures that can forget. We have a horizon, beyond which we can remember very little. Nothing can reside in our minds forever, etched into us. No resentment, and no joy. Time rubs it away. Sleep rubs it away âsleep, the factory of forgetting. And through forgetting, we reorganize our world, replace our old selves with new ones.â</p>
<p>The mountain in the sea.
Ray Nayler.</p>
<p>Itâs hard to say how much actually happened and how much is the work of âmemory overlayâ through more than fifteen years. Not sure which I prefer, either. But, in any case, itâs been good to be back for a little bit.</p>
