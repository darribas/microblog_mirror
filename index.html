Her recipe for longevity was good children (you had to be lucky with that. She had the best child in the world), and lots of dark chocolate. Most important, though, was always to have a plan.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Earlier this week, I participated in a [panel on the Land Use Framework](Edge Debate 179) at <a href="https://www.futurebuild.co.uk/">FutureBuild'25</a>. This was curated by <a href="https://edgedebate.com/">Edge</a>, and co-panelists included Baroness Young of Old Scone (Chair), Maya Singer Hobbs, Carolyn McKenzie, and Stephen Hill. Each of us spoke for 5-7minutes and then the chair opened for questions from the floor.</p>
<p>In my talk, titled &ldquo;Land use data to inform decision making - <em>How it could work</em>&rdquo;, I tried to make three clear points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Good decisions are linked to the “state” of land, and this is too complex to understand without direct evidence. (Good) data provide the context for (good) decisions.</li>
<li>We need data that changes &ldquo;at the speed of decisions&rdquo;. This context needs to reflect the current state of affairs, which changes much more rapidly than we have been able to gather data from  in the past.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a lot of <em>very cool</em> stuff happening in the world of data to support this view of the world. For example, and I may be biased here, the single most exciting development of the last ten years is the ability to make increasingly more abundant imagery from satellites <em>computable</em> so it can feed into these decisions.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>Given the prompt to talk about &ldquo;how it could work&rdquo;, I gave a shout to our <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/demoland">DemoLand</a> project, as an illustration of how to combine data and AI to support land use decisions.</p>
<p>I closed the intervention with an afterword, two points I really wanted to make but couldn&rsquo;t elegantly squeeze in the previous part:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data (as well as the models and, eventually, digital twins they feed into) are best thought of as human augmentation rather than replacement. As much as some might like it that way, I <em>don&rsquo;t</em> think any of this is about the robots taking over the job of the planners, it&rsquo;s about super-charging planners!</li>
<li><em>Urban land is land!</em> This is by now one of my hobby horses. Much of the land discussion (be it on modelling, understanding or affecting it through policy) is focused on &ldquo;most of the land&rdquo;. This makes sense to a certain extent. After all, cities are about 5% of the land. However, if we&rsquo;re serious about curving emissions and building a better home for most of the population, this 5% clearly punches above its weight (e.g., about 75% emissions come from cities whom, in a country like the UK, house about 80% of the population).</li>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s that time of the year. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Spotify just dropped Wrapped.
The lists of the best everything in 2024 start rolling on.
And I can&rsquo;t help having a go at mine. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> One of the few practices I&rsquo;ve kept over the years, even in the face of pretty
substantial life style changes (e.g., baby) is reading. So, here&rsquo;s my list of
books from 2024.
Let&rsquo;s get all due caveats out of the way first of all. It&rsquo;s
technically not a &ldquo;best of&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;all of&rdquo;. I did not <em>love</em> all the
books in there, but I did read them. Unlike many smart people profess, I have a really hard time
giving up on a book I have started. This year though, I&rsquo;m glad I stuck with all
of them. Also, technically, I did not <em>read</em> all of them either. A good chunk of
them I listened to while doing the dishes (more on this below). And, at the risk of stating the obvious, it&rsquo;s
December 11th., the year has not ended. I&rsquo;m currently on three books
(<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/144421737-what-if-we-get-it-right">one</a>,
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40859000-delta-v">two</a>,
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112976320-how-infrastructure-works?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=HAl0FKAfW5&amp;rank=1">three</a>)
that I might or not finnish before the year is out. All are very good.
Unless something radical changes, none would replace my picks this year.
So, on we go.</p>
<p>If by best we mean a book that makes you stay up way too late reading, and you
think about long after you&rsquo;ve finished, the clear winner this year is <em>The
Deluge</em>. It&rsquo;s hard to state in words how much I liked what is a 900p. book mostly
about climate change. Don&rsquo;t be fooled though, this is not the type of
sci/cli-fi where characters and story are simple vehicles for the Big Ideas.
There are lots of those (Big Ideas), but there are also real characters.
People you come to love, despise, and find uncomfortably close to you. Since I
finished it, I&rsquo;ve been looking for someone, anyone, who&rsquo;s read it too and is
up for a coffee, because there are so many bits I&rsquo;d like to discuss with
another human about this book. Unfortunately though, the search goes on&hellip;</p>
<p>The other book that surprised me in many and good ways was <em>Doppelganger</em>.
I&rsquo;m the proud owner of a 1,999 paper copy of NoLogo, which I devoured as a
highschool student. After that, I figured there would be little in Naomi
Klein&rsquo;s writing I wouldn&rsquo;t agree with or would change my views, so did not
read more. How wrong I was. Admittedly, this is the most and least Klein book
I can think of. It is something only her could have written and only now,
after decades of craft. And is a really hard book to pull off. It&rsquo;s about so
many things (her confusion with Naomi Wolf, conspiracy theories, right-wing
politics in the XXIst Century, doppelgangers in culture and art over history,
Jewish identity&hellip;) that it is hard to classify or even summarise. But it&rsquo;s
well worth your time. Go read (listen to) it.</p>
<p>Honorary mentions. This has been a good year for reads. It&rsquo;s also been a
terrible year in many personal aspects of my life. In the worst of it in May,
I picked up <em>Where there&rsquo;s a will</em>, and I&rsquo;m so glad I did. Chappell&rsquo;s account
of what it really means to win a race so brutal like the Transcontinental is
everything I needed to read about human endurance, empathy, and
humbleness.
<em>Impossible people</em> was also a phenomenal (graphic) read. Wertz&rsquo;s account of
her own alcoholism is so raw, hopeful, and just pure
funny.
And last but not least, <em>Devil in a blue dress</em>. My friend Al turned me on to
this, and I&rsquo;m so glad he did. This is L.A. Confidential from the
African-American perspective. It&rsquo;s a great detective story, it&rsquo;s so well
written, and it&rsquo;s an approach to race that, although written in the early 90s,
reads just as fresh in 2024.</p>
<p>A couple of thoughts to close. First, almost all
non-fiction I consumed this year was listened. I&rsquo;d love to have the brightness
and mental capacity to spend 40 minutes every night getting lost in thorough
arguments. The truth is I don&rsquo;t. Instead, I do have about that time every
night when I wash the dishes and clean the kitchen. One day, in an ideal
world, I&rsquo;ll do all my reading, well, by reading. For what is worth, I do agree
with the snob argument that reading is a better way to engage with writing
than listening. It gives you more space to think and let the content change
you. It&rsquo;s just that such option is not in the cards right
now.
Second, I have tried to read as much from women as from men now for a few
years, with varying degrees of success. This year I think I was fairly OK with
it. This year, it&rsquo;s almost been a perfect split between fiction (men) and
non-fiction (women). I need more female fiction
recommendations!
And third, something I started this year is to systematically take notes and
write down impressions as I was reading. I started towards the autumn, so I&rsquo;ll
reserve conclusions on that for the future (including whether the practice
sticks at all!).</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s it, one more year. If you know me a bit, you know I like talking
books, and I&rsquo;m <em>always</em> looking for more recommendations. So feel free to hit
me up with books that have made your 2024 a better tour around the sun!</p>

<p><em><strong>How geospatial AI can help inform our land use choices</strong></em>. Blog post from the Geospatial Commission on the report - <a href="https://geospatialcommission.blog.gov.uk/2024/11/14/how-geospatial-ai-can-help-inform-our-land-use-choices/"><code>URL</code></a></p>
<p>TODAY, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/geospatial-commission">Geospatial Commission</a> released the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/geospatial-ai-for-land-use-by-the-alan-turing-institute/geospatial-ai-for-land-use-by-the-alan-turing-institute">report</a> we<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> prepared for a project we have been working over the last year in collaboration with them. The work builds on our earlier contribution to the National Land Data Programme<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> last year, and the document puts in writing much of what we <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/geospatial-commission-funded-tool-demonstrates-potential-for-ai-to-transform-decisions-about-land-use">presented to the minister for AI and intellectual property</a> last March. There is also an accompanying <a href="https://geospatialcommission.blog.gov.uk/2024/11/14/how-geospatial-ai-can-help-inform-our-land-use-choices/">blog post</a> Mehul and his team at the Commission put out.</p>
<p>Most of the report is a summary of what we learned in two specific
exercises and a series of engagement events. I&rsquo;ll give you the two-sentence version of each here but, if you are interested, you really should grab the report as it covers them much more comprehensively.
In one, we took our initial <a href="https://urban-analytics-technology-platform.github.io/demoland-web/tyne_and_wear_hex/#10.06/55.1137/-1.5308">DemoLand app</a>, a tool that helps users explore different land use scenarios and their effect on areas such as air quality or house prices, and embedded a chat interface powered by a large language model. The original tool provided access to a lot of data and modelling that would be hard to access for non-technical audiences otherwise, but it still required the user to &ldquo;know their way around&rdquo;. With the new chat-based interface, exploring the results is a much more conversational experience that can reach larger even audiences.
In the second exercise, we digged into the guts of the models that power land
use applications such as those in DemoLand. Typically, many of these require
data that is collected and released more slowly than ideally required for
decision making (e.g., Census or building cadasters). We explored
complementing, or even replacing, these by widely available satellite imagery.
Satellite data is definitely not a new thing, we&rsquo;ve had metal boxes orbitting
the Earth since at least the 1950s, but there are a few <em>recent</em> things that
make them more appealing. The revolution in computer vision (and what is now
also termed AI) we have seen in the last 15 years has changed what we are able
to do with imagery, even that of limited spatial resolution. In this exercise,
we explore foundation models for vision (a bit like the GPT in ChatGPT but for
satellite data) to see how far we could push them. The result is a series of
what I consider extremely exciting results but others might see as largely dry
performance scores tables. You can get a summary of those in the report.
In addition to these two exercises, we also ran consultation events (at <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/ai-uk-2024">AI
UK'24</a> and online) with experts to
get a broader view on the potential, challenges and immediate opportunities of
geospatial AI for land use. I could summarise those, but I won&rsquo;t do a better
job than the report, so head over to its &ldquo;Section 3&rdquo; for that.</p>
<p>What will probably (I hope!) catch most attention is the &ldquo;Recommendations&rdquo;
section. Here is where we brought together everything we learnt in these
exercises to propose concrete steps forward. In particular, we mention five:</p>
<p>1/ Identify additional areas of opportunity for satellite data to build the value case for geospatial AI.</p>
<p>2/ Develop a Geospatial AI Toolkit for LLMs.</p>
<p>3/ Expand the conversation on national foundation models to land use and geospatial.</p>
<p>4/ Improve access to key computational and data resources.</p>
<p>5/ Promote knowledge sharing and cross-discipline collaboratio.</p>
<p>Some are self-explanatory and I suspect few will disagree with them (who is
against more knowledge sharing?). Others bring to the front
discussions that we think deserve more attention than they&rsquo;re currently
receiving. LLMs, for example, are not very good at geography (there is a
reason why the second L is not a G!). Before we jump in and take them
off-the-self, we think there is work to do to develop the &ldquo;Geography
curriculum&rdquo; we&rsquo;d like these models to know when they help folks on
spatial domains. And others seem more obvious than they actually are.
Suggesting in 2024 that satellite data be used for land use change may cause
unreparable eye-rolls among land use experts who&rsquo;ve been doing this in an
academic context for several decades. Yet there is still very little of it
that has made it into &ldquo;production&rdquo; at scale, particularly in non environmental
and physical domains such as cities and society<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. So think twice before sending your eyes upwards.</p>
<p>Above all, and ironically given that it summarises past work, we hope this becomes a conversation starter. There is so much exciting stuff that is happening in the world of AI that could have tremendous implications for land use modelling and management. <em>What</em> exactly and, specially, <em>how</em> are debates we have just begun and are far from done. But we think they are worth having <em>and</em> actioning on. To work.</p>

			 <p>âThat&rsquo;s what we are, we humans âcreatures that can forget. We have a horizon, beyond which we can remember very little. Nothing can reside in our minds forever, etched into us. No resentment, and no joy. Time rubs it away. Sleep rubs it away âsleep, the factory of forgetting. And through forgetting, we reorganize our world, replace our old selves with new ones.â</p>

<p>Pao de queijo (cheese bread) is baked and, when done right, is crispy in the outside and always creamy in the inside. The suco de laranja (orange juice) is always freshly squeezed and comes from oranges that aren&rsquo;t generally orange but yellow and green, almost like a giant lime. They are sweet like an orange though. And the coffee, oh Brazilian coffee. All together the for less than $1. [one for @8tlas)]</p>
